Climate Change projections for Somalia will be used to derive information regarding the potential increase of the threats of climate extremes on future development and livelihoods. Data from the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) Africa framework was used in this study to project scenarios for precipitation in Lower Jubba. At the same time the analysis showed significant biases in individual models depending on sub-region and season; however, the ensemble mean had better agreement with observation than individual models. The analysis concluded that the multi-model ensemble mean simulates eastern Africa rainfall adequately and could therefore be used for the assessment of future climate projections for the region. The ensemble model data was used in this study to compute the correlation value r and linear trend lines for each pixel for the individual seasons. For the study area, the ensemble mean results were found to simulate fairly well the annual rainfall cycle when compared to individual RCM models. Results from the study showed that the ensemble models closely reproduced realistic representation of the observed climate features. Thus projection of future rainfall scenarios was undertaken for only the Gu (AMJ) season. The projections undertaken for temperature were observed for all seasons. The spatial representation of the projected rainfall trends showed no homogenous patterns throughout the three study sub periods. Like the observed GISTEMP data [20], the average temperature seems to increase towards the southern costal band in all seasons, possibly due to influence by Indian Ocean [50] . In general, the projections for Lower Jubba indicated an increase in minimum and maximum temperatures in all seasons in the projection periods 2030, 2050 and 2070. Temperature projections are critical in the development of effective and realistic climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction strategies.

 Article summaries created:  The Effect of Climate on the Chemical Composition of the Coral Reefs around Kubbar                    IslandâKuwait

The total number of gathered sediment              samples is 48 and is from three different seasons. Few bulk sediment samples were analyzed by X-Ray diffraction method to determine              the mineral constituent. Separated coral fragments from all locations              around Kubbar Islands used in chemical analysis. The mean temperature reaches 45˚C in July and August, and 12˚C              in winter [10]. The mean rain-fall precipitation from November to January equals to 112.09              mm [12]. The mean rainfall              precipitation from February to April equals to 112.09 mm [12]. The most              dominant nonclastic constituent within the sediment samples is quartz. Other nonclastic components include heavy minerals,              metallic particles, rusty iron particles, and feldspars. The existence of such crystals is an indication of high              temperatures and salinity. The majority of crystals are found free, not attached              to the grains composing the sediment samples.

 Article summaries created: Decision-Making in Foreign Language Reduces Emotional Arousal
by Josef N. Lazar, Atar Stern, Ran Cohen, Received 17 October 2014; revised 14 November 2014; accepted 11 December 2014
Past researches have shown a reduction in emotional reactivity in a foreign language using physiological measures, but not during decision making processes. In order to assess the emotional arousal of the participants we measured it with the physiological apparatus ECG. In order to assess the emotional arousal of the participants we also measured it using the physiological apparatus GSR. In a counterbalanced design, the participants were randomly assigned to perform a decision making task using a different language each time. To avoid unrelated emotional bias, each participant first watched an emotional neutral video clip; followed by three self-report questionnaires for assessing the emotional base level (Appendix 2). In the current research we tested for significant differences of physiological arousal among bilinguals, using native-tongue versus second language, during a decision making task. To examine our participantsâ arousal we used three different electrophysiological measures; Also, the task used in the decision making process was scored for emotional arousal. With respect to earlier results, we hypothesized that late bilinguals will show less emotional reactivity during the task while using their second language. We used a repeated measures ANOVA test to check for interactions between the RATC-II task and the electrophysiological measures?but no significant interactions were found (p > 0.05). A significant difference was found for the scoring of the decision making task, that was in accordance with our hypothesis. However, the participants showed higher arousal levels while using L2, as opposed to the results of the RATC-II and our initial hypothesis. Unfortunately, we didnât test for anxiety levels before the English screening test; hence, we canât determine that indeed the second language anxiety had such an effect on our results. Far as we know, this task has not been used before in studies of decision making and/or emotional assessment among bilinguals.

 Article summaries created: Empathy Diminishes Prejudice: Active Perspective-Taking, Regardless of Target and Mortality Salience, Decreases Implicit Racial Bias
by Travis J. Pashak, McCall A. Conley, Drew J. Whitney, Samuel R. Oswald, Stephanie G. Heckroth, Evan M. Schumacher, Received: April 27, 2018; Accepted: June 25, 2018; Published: June 29, 2018
The alternative to the MAPS (used in the control condition) is a similarly-worded essay prompt in which subjects are asked to envision a routine dental visit. In the social empathy experimental condition, participants viewed a 20-minute clip of a documentary titled True Colors available on YouTube (  Pearce & Ross, 1991 ; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oi_DF9Iu2xA). The interaction effect between essay condition and empathy condition was not statistically significant, F(1, 107) = 2.90, p = .091. Thus, the four experimental groups did not statistically significantly differ in their Race IAT change scores. The interaction effect between essay condition and empathy condition was not statistically significant, F(2, 106) = .15, p = .863, Wilksâ Lambda = .99. Thus, the four experimental groups did not statistically significantly differ on their SEE or QDI scores. A paired-samples t-test was conducted to evaluate the possibility that, regardless of experimental group (i.e., across the whole sample), the empathy induction task may have impacted implicit racial bias. This would account for why, despite not specifically empathizing with a Black person, the White participants in the TED Talk condition exhibited decreased bias.
