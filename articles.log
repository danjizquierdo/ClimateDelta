Climate Change projections for Somalia will be used to derive information regarding the potential increase of the threats of climate extremes on future development and livelihoods. Data from the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) Africa framework was used in this study to project scenarios for precipitation in Lower Jubba. At the same time the analysis showed significant biases in individual models depending on sub-region and season; however, the ensemble mean had better agreement with observation than individual models. The analysis concluded that the multi-model ensemble mean simulates eastern Africa rainfall adequately and could therefore be used for the assessment of future climate projections for the region. The ensemble model data was used in this study to compute the correlation value r and linear trend lines for each pixel for the individual seasons. For the study area, the ensemble mean results were found to simulate fairly well the annual rainfall cycle when compared to individual RCM models. Results from the study showed that the ensemble models closely reproduced realistic representation of the observed climate features. Thus projection of future rainfall scenarios was undertaken for only the Gu (AMJ) season. The projections undertaken for temperature were observed for all seasons. The spatial representation of the projected rainfall trends showed no homogenous patterns throughout the three study sub periods. Like the observed GISTEMP data [20], the average temperature seems to increase towards the southern costal band in all seasons, possibly due to influence by Indian Ocean [50] . In general, the projections for Lower Jubba indicated an increase in minimum and maximum temperatures in all seasons in the projection periods 2030, 2050 and 2070. Temperature projections are critical in the development of effective and realistic climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction strategies.

The total number of gathered sediment              samples is 48 and is from three different seasons. Few bulk sediment samples were analyzed by X-Ray diffraction method to determine              the mineral constituent. Separated coral fragments from all locations              around Kubbar Islands used in chemical analysis. The mean temperature reaches 45˚C in July and August, and 12˚C              in winter [10]. The mean rain-fall precipitation from November to January equals to 112.09              mm [12]. The mean rainfall              precipitation from February to April equals to 112.09 mm [12]. The most              dominant nonclastic constituent within the sediment samples is quartz. Other nonclastic components include heavy minerals,              metallic particles, rusty iron particles, and feldspars. The existence of such crystals is an indication of high              temperatures and salinity. The majority of crystals are found free, not attached              to the grains composing the sediment samples.

 Article summaries created: Decision-Making in Foreign Language Reduces Emotional Arousal
by Josef N. Lazar, Atar Stern, Ran Cohen, Received 17 October 2014; revised 14 November 2014; accepted 11 December 2014
Past researches have shown a reduction in emotional reactivity in a foreign language using physiological measures, but not during decision making processes. In order to assess the emotional arousal of the participants we measured it with the physiological apparatus ECG. In order to assess the emotional arousal of the participants we also measured it using the physiological apparatus GSR. In a counterbalanced design, the participants were randomly assigned to perform a decision making task using a different language each time. To avoid unrelated emotional bias, each participant first watched an emotional neutral video clip; followed by three self-report questionnaires for assessing the emotional base level (Appendix 2). In the current research we tested for significant differences of physiological arousal among bilinguals, using native-tongue versus second language, during a decision making task. To examine our participantsâ arousal we used three different electrophysiological measures; Also, the task used in the decision making process was scored for emotional arousal. With respect to earlier results, we hypothesized that late bilinguals will show less emotional reactivity during the task while using their second language. We used a repeated measures ANOVA test to check for interactions between the RATC-II task and the electrophysiological measures?but no significant interactions were found (p > 0.05). A significant difference was found for the scoring of the decision making task, that was in accordance with our hypothesis. However, the participants showed higher arousal levels while using L2, as opposed to the results of the RATC-II and our initial hypothesis. Unfortunately, we didnât test for anxiety levels before the English screening test; hence, we canât determine that indeed the second language anxiety had such an effect on our results. Far as we know, this task has not been used before in studies of decision making and/or emotional assessment among bilinguals.

 Article summaries created: Empathy Diminishes Prejudice: Active Perspective-Taking, Regardless of Target and Mortality Salience, Decreases Implicit Racial Bias
by Travis J. Pashak, McCall A. Conley, Drew J. Whitney, Samuel R. Oswald, Stephanie G. Heckroth, Evan M. Schumacher, Received: April 27, 2018; Accepted: June 25, 2018; Published: June 29, 2018
The alternative to the MAPS (used in the control condition) is a similarly-worded essay prompt in which subjects are asked to envision a routine dental visit. In the social empathy experimental condition, participants viewed a 20-minute clip of a documentary titled True Colors available on YouTube (  Pearce & Ross, 1991 ; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oi_DF9Iu2xA). The interaction effect between essay condition and empathy condition was not statistically significant, F(1, 107) = 2.90, p = .091. Thus, the four experimental groups did not statistically significantly differ in their Race IAT change scores. The interaction effect between essay condition and empathy condition was not statistically significant, F(2, 106) = .15, p = .863, Wilksâ Lambda = .99. Thus, the four experimental groups did not statistically significantly differ on their SEE or QDI scores. A paired-samples t-test was conducted to evaluate the possibility that, regardless of experimental group (i.e., across the whole sample), the empathy induction task may have impacted implicit racial bias. This would account for why, despite not specifically empathizing with a Black person, the White participants in the TED Talk condition exhibited decreased bias.

 Article summaries created: Application of Integrated Reorganization of Science Specimen Data Using Kettle
by Zhiyuan Wu, Yang Mei, Received: October 26, 2018; Accepted: January 1, 2019; Published: January 4, 2019
ETL which is the main technology to build data warehouse and realize data integration can solve many problems faced by the integration of scientific specimen data. It is a data integration tool often used in the integration of heterogeneous multiple data sources. Kettle has good performances in data source support, data transformation, data management and scheduling, integration and openness, and metadata management, etc. The target database will provide basic data sources for data management, data sharing, data mining, and data analysis of science specimen resources. That requires resource units to send the specimen data to centralized specimen data center or provide data interfaces, and then the data center uniformly reorganizes the source data. They are as follows: 1) Tabular data: Data are stored in two-dimensional tables, including specimen data sheets, specimen hierarchical classification and coding table, and resource unit table. Data format, content, method of collection, and data quality of the source data must be understood before data integration. The target database provides a standard data source for resource management system, and can be exported to other data format such as Excel file. According to the established reorganization scheme, data source of specimen resource is analyzed first, then data integration flow is designed in kettle. In this paper, mineral, rock and fossil specimen data reorganization was taken as an example for the reorganization of science specimen data. The result shows that reorganization by using kettle can solve the problem that data is difficult to achieve integration efficiently when the specimen data are multi-source and heterogeneous.

 Article summaries created: Sensitivity of Amazon Regional Climate to Deforestation
by Lincoln Muniz Alves, Jose A. Marengo, Rong Fu, Rodrigo J. Bombardi, Received: November 17, 2016; Accepted: March 4, 2017; Published: March 7, 2017
Despite annual rainfall in the Amazon basin being ge-nerally above 2000 mm, about two-thirds of the Amazon forests experience a marked dry season from July to October. For instance, the increase in rainfall is mainly observed in smaller deforestation extent, while the majority of experiments with high deforestation rates simulate a reduction in rainfall. Furthermore, the authors alto emphasize that simulated change in rainfall are highly dependent of the climate modelâland surface modelâused [52] . Furthermore, several studies of Amazon deforestation have indicated that large- scale deforestation may lead to warmer surface temperatures and less evaporation and rainfall. Even in the absence of anthropogenic deforestation, some climate projections indicate a risk of climate change-driven rainforest dieback [55] [56] . It should be noted that the majority of simulations and studies have been used GCMs to assess the impact of land use change on climate. Therefore, use of regional climate models should potential improve the re-pre- sentation of the climate information that is important for impact assessments at a regional level. For more information about the scenario process and the Land Use and Cover Change (LUCC) modeling framework can be found in Aguiar et al. (1) The accumulated precipitation anomalies are computed starting from the dry season (date of the minimum in the precipitation annual cycle, t0) for each grid point. Additionally, analyses to assess rainfall extremes were performed using the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) developed by Mckee et al. Average evaporation decreased from 0.89 mm/day during the dry season to 0.57 mm/day during the wet warm season DJF for CEN2050 over NEAMZ relative to the control experiment.

A website for the Global Agni-karma group (http://globalagnikarma.com) was supplied to the patients as an educational tool to educate patients about the technique. Patients were allocated to one of two groups: 1) Intervention group; included patients who agreed to receive PNFS-TMC in addition to the standard WHO stepladder analgesics. 16 patients declined PNFS-TMC and were subsequently included in the control group, 30 patients agreed to receive PNFS-TMC and were included in the intervention group. 14 patients out of 30 patients in the intervention group could not complete 4 sessions, these patients were excluded from the analysis. The intervention group patients were scheduled to have 4 sessions, 2 weeks apart, over a period of 8 weeks. VAS pain score was obtained verbally by a phone call in the control group, after explaining the score to the patients. 16 patients declined PNFS-TMC and were assigned to the control group with one patient lost to follow up during the 8 weeks follow up. Data from 16 patients in the intervention group and 15 patients in the control group were analysed (Figure 1). 4 sessions), was significantly lower in the PNFS-TMC group than in the Control group [4.64 ± 2.08 (95% CI 3.57 to 5.72) VAS: Visual Analogue Score. None of the PNFS-TMC patients reported worsening of daily activity versus 5 patients (33.3%) in the control group, P < 0.0001. In the PNFS-TMC group: 6 patients (40%) were interested in having more sessions, while 9 patients (60%) were not interested in having more sessions. 2 patients (12.5%), out of the 16 patients in the Intervention group cancelled their TKR as pain level decreased to a satisfactory level (Table 3). Regression analysis showed a significant correlation between best pain score after 4 sessions and activity after 4 sessions in PNFS-TMC group (R2 = 0.006, P = 0.0285). PNFS-TMC resulted in improved daily activity in a majority of patients (68.7%) which did not happen with any patient in the control group (P < 0.0001).

There exist different types of vaccines in clinical use. Several factors still limit the effectiveness of vaccination, which must be overcomed with the advances in the biotechnology field and a deeper comprehension of the immune system. In this regard, a new generation of vaccines is being developed to overcome technological limitations and to achieve safety and desirable requirements to prevent and/or treat diseases [7] . And, recently, several approaches, such as DNA vaccines, have been developed to improve vaccine safety and efficacy using sophisticated biological technologies.

The median of hepatitis B is Shanxi, and the median of hepatitis C is Guizhou, and they were categorized as high incidence area. The highest incidence rate of hepatitis B was Xinjiang (164.31 per thousand people), and the lowest was Beijing (7.82 per thousand people). The highest incidence rate of hepatitis C was also Xinjiang (47.66 per thousand people), and the lowest was Xizang (0.98 per thousand people). The mean incidence rates of hepatitis B and hepatitis C in 31 provinces of China in 2015 were 70.03 and 16.51 per 100 thousand people, respectively. The mean incidence rates of hepatitis B in high and low incidence areas were 101.12 and 36.88 per 100 thousand people, respectively. The incidence rates of hepatitis C in high and low incidence areas were 24.57 and 7.91 per 100 thousand people, respectively. According to the results, the high incidence area of hepatitis B was also a high incidence area of hepatitis C, except the region of Xizang. Xizang was in a high incidence area of hepatitis B, but it was a low incidence area of hepatitis C (Table 1). Group education = Public health education activities. They have the higher awareness of their own health, the intention to accept disease-related knowledge than other areas because of relatively higher income and knowledge. For the floating population, we need to focus on improving their knowledge of hepatitis and health awareness according to their education level. As a result, the people in higher regional GDP per capita have more opportunities for early diagnosis and treatment to prevent disease-related complications. Even for high incidence areas, the governmentâs emphasis on disease prevention is higher than that of low incidence areas.

 Article summaries created: Climate Change Projections and the Associated Potential Impacts for Somalia
by Linda Ajuang Ogallo, Philip Omondi, Gilbert Ouma, Gordon Wayumba, Received: March 2, 2018; Accepted: May 15, 2018; Published: May 18, 2018
Keywords:  Increasing evidence is able to link climate change to major and minor threats to natural systems, threatening environmental, social and economic development [1] [2] . Climate change impacts are projected to slow down economic growth, making poverty reduction even more difficult, while prolonging existing poverty traps [2] . Increase in temperature could also change the ecology of infectious diseases as well as increase temperature related mortality and morbidity of people and livestock [2] [26] [27] . Climate Change projections for Somalia will be used to derive information regarding the potential increase of the threats of climate extremes on future development and livelihoods. Data from the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) Africa framework was used in this study to project scenarios for precipitation in Lower Jubba. At the same time the analysis showed significant biases in individual models depending on sub-region and season; however, the ensemble mean had better agreement with observation than individual models. The analysis concluded that the multi-model ensemble mean simulates eastern Africa rainfall adequately and could therefore be used for the assessment of future climate projections for the region. The CORDEX RCMs data was obtained from IGAD Climate Prediction and Application Centre (ICPAC) which is the WMO regional climate center for the Greater Horn of Africa. The ensemble model data was used in this study to compute the correlation value r and linear trend lines for each pixel for the individual seasons. The results from model verification and climate change projections with CORDEX RCA4.5 models are independently highlighted in the following sections. Results from the study showed that the ensemble models closely reproduced realistic representation of the observed climate features. Temperature projections are critical in the development of effective and realistic climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction strategies. With the prolonging socio economic stability in the country, the development of the required community based effective climate smart adaptation systems will require support from global and regional partners.

 Article summaries created: Effect of localized oil spills on Atlantic loggerhead population dynamics
by Margaret-Rose Leung, Melissa Marchand, Samantha Stykel, My Huynh, José D. Flores, Received 30 April 2012; revised 2 June 2012; accepted 30 June 2012
The loggerhead turtle (Caretta caretta) is one of six endangered sea turtles in the Atlantic Ocean threatened by human activities [1]. Existing models of loggerhead turtles focus on the stage classes most sensitive to long-term population growth. Our research is motivated by the potential impact of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill on loggerhead turtles in the western North Atlantic Ocean. Since neritic immature turtles forage outside their nesting region, a localized spill may affect turtles from any nesting region, making the spatial component of our model crucial. Since a negligible number of loggerhead turtles nest away from their hatching region [10], we modeled the population from each nesting region with an independent matrix representation. All turtles spend their first year as eggs/hatchlings (stage class B) in their hatching region. After sexual maturation, turtles become adults (A) and return to their hatching region, where we assume they remain indefinitely.

This was done using the downscaled Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) RCMs data. The annual rainfall and temperature cycles simulated by an ensemble of CORDEX RCMs were compared with the observed data. The analysis focused on the Gu long rain season, which had the best agreement in comparison to the observed rainfall data. Projections for temperature were done for all the standard global climatological seasons namely northern hemisphere summer, winter, autumn and spring seasons that correspond to June to August, December to February, September to November, March to May months. The projections of the future Gu long rain season characteristics was done using the IPCC projected periods of 2030, 2050 and 2070 benchmarks. Lower Jubba is located in the Jubaland state of Somalia [17] [18] . Jubaland consists of the Gedo, Lower Jubba and Middle Jubba regions, and lies 40 - 60 km east of the Jubba River, stretching from Gedo to the Indian Ocean. The state of Jubaland borders the Garrisa, Wajir and Mandera County of Kenya on the western side. Kismayo, located in Lower Jubba, is the largest city in Jubaland, and the third largest city in Somalia after Mogadishu and Hargesa [19] . Lower Jubba receives about 350 mm rainfall during Gu (AMJ) season and an average of 250 mm Deyr (SON) season. Lower Jubba saw a general decreasing trend in rainfall during the Gu rainfall season, and a general increasing trend in the Deyr rainfall between 1981 to 2015 [20] . The Lower Jubba region has also experienced an increase in occurrence of depressed rainfall usually associated with drought, and a decrease in the frequency of above normal rainfall associated with floods [20] . Studies on the GHA show a decrease of MAM long rains and increase in the OND short rains [21] [22] [23] . Lower Jubba has seen increasing trends in the minimum, maximum and average temperature [20], consistent with the results from many recent studies worldwide [2] [24] [25] . Increase in temperature could also change the ecology of infectious diseases as well as increase temperature related mortality and morbidity of people and livestock [2] [26] [27] . Climate Change projections for Somalia will be used to derive information regarding the potential increase of the threats of climate extremes on future development and livelihoods. It will also enable the development of effective climate smart adaptation strategies. Details of area of study, data used and methodologies adopted are highlighted in the following sections. Gridded CHIRPS and GeoCLIM observations for the period 1960-90 were used as the baseline observations data. CHIRPS is a global dataset (50Ë\x9aS - 50Ë\x9aN, 180Ë\x9aE - 180Ë\x9aW), 0.05Ë\x9a resolution, 1981 to near-present gridded precipitation time series. CHIRPS data are produced by scientists at the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) Climate Hazard Group (CHG) and the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Earth Resources Observation and Science (EROS) Center. The data was developed to support the United States Agency for International Development Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET). Rainfall Measuring Mission Multi-satellite Precipitation Analysis version 7 (TMPA 3B42 v7) is used to calibrate global Cold Cloud Duration (CCD) rainfall estimates. Details on CHIRPS data and their usability in the region are well documented by ICPAC among many others [28] [29] . A coordinated set of the 20th and 21st century climate simulations for the Atmosphere Ocean coupled Global Climate Models (AOGCMs) in the Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5) have been contributed to by climate modelling groups from all around the world [30] . Data from the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) Africa framework was used in this study to project scenarios for precipitation in Lower Jubba. The CORDEX program is an initiative by World Climate Research Program (WCRP) of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) that generates high-resolution climate projections (50 km) for climate studies, within the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) timeline and beyond [31] [32] [33] . CORDEX data used in this study represented precipitation fairly well over the region and thus can be used to inform on adaptation and mitigation strategies [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] . These climate models describe the coupling of the atmosphere with the land surface, with differing dynamics and physics formulations [31] [37] . For each experiment the historical runs, forced by observed natural and anthropogenic atmospheric composition, cover the period from 1950-2005. The future projections (2006-2100) are forced with two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP), namely; RCP4.5 (mid-range emissions) and RCP8.5 (high-end emissions) scenarios, which prescribe future atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations and aerosols. Detail on the CORDEX RCMs can be found in Endris [32] and Nikulin [33] . Endris [32] evaluated the ability of the CORDEX RCMs in simulating the general characteristics of the climate over Eastern Africa region by analyzing the annual cycle, spatial variability, pattern correlation and root mean square error using a Taylor diagram. The study found that these RCMs reasonably simulate the main features of the rainfall climatology over eastern Africa and also reproduce the majority of the documented regional responses to ENSO and IOD forcings. At the same time the analysis showed significant biases in individual models depending on sub-region and season; however, the ensemble mean had better agreement with observation than individual models. The analysis concluded that the multi-model ensemble mean simulates eastern Africa rainfall adequately and could therefore be used for the assessment of future climate projections for the region. The CORDEX RCMs data was obtained from IGAD Climate Prediction and Application Centre (ICPAC) which is the WMO regional climate center for the Greater Horn of Africa. In this study the region of interest was Lower Jubba that is bounded by latitudes 1.5Ë\x9aS - 12.0Ë\x9aN and longitudes 41.0Ë\x9aE - 51.0Ë\x9aE. There IPCC based climate projection reference period were used namely 2030 (sub-period 1), sub-period up to 2050 (sub-period 2), and sub-period up to 2070 (sub-period 3). The study was divided into two major sections namely assessment of Model Skill in Simulating Observed Climate during the period 1961-1990, and the projection of future rainfall and temperature scenarios. Standard methods were adopted to determine the best climate model/s that could be used for the projection of future climate change scenarios for Lower Jubba region of Somalia for the two standard rainfall seasons Gu (April to June) and Deyr (September to November). The temperature simulations were for all standard seasons of the year in Somalia namely December-February (DJF), March-May (MAM), July-August (JJA), and September-November (SON). Standard methods were also adopted to test the spatial and temporal bias of the individual models. The methods used included various time series methods, correlation and regression analysis. Correlation methods examined correlations between the observed and simulated outputs at specific grid point locations. The square of the correlation coefficient is knows as coefficient of determination (r2) which represented the variance of the observed data that could be accounted for by the predicted variable. Regression method attempted to fit the best linear mathematical equation for the observed relationships. The statistical significance of the fitted linear regression trends were examined using graphical approaches as well as the standards statistical test that include the use of Mann-Kendall Rank Statistics. Similar methods have been adopted in many studies in Africa and the world at large [6] [20] [22] [24] [38] [39] [40] . A linear regression trend was investigated by examining the relationship between time (T) and the variable of interest (X), in this case rainfall, using the following equation X(t) is the individual observed seasonal rainfall/temperature during the baseline period 1960-1990, while Y(t) are corresponding values simulated by the individual CORDEX models over the period 1961-1990, c and b are normally the intercept and gradient (slope) of the regression equation. The slope indicates the average rate of change in the dependent variable in each year of the given time period. A positive/negative slope shows an increasing/decreasing trend respectively. The limitation of this method is that it assumes that all linkages between observed and CORDEX models generated models are linear, and the distributions of the observed and predicted records are normal. For non-normal data the study included nonparametric tests namely the Mann-Kendall rank statistics method was used. In the Mann-Kendall analysis data is ranked after being placed in time sequential order. The time series values (X1, X2, X3, X4 â\x80¦, Xn) where X in this case represents rainfall are replaced by their relative ranks (R1, R2, R3, R4 â\x80¦, Rn) (starting from the lowest value up to n). The relative magnitudes of sample data is compared rather than the data values themselves [41] [42] [43] . The equation used is as follows, where S is the Kendall score given a dataset R with a sample size of n values. The Kendall statistics s is given in Equation (2) below based on Kendall, 1938; 1945; 1948 The observed trend is significant if s values in Equation (2) have significance levels equal or less than 0.5. The ensemble model data was used in this study to compute the correlation value r and linear trend lines for each pixel for the individual seasons. The results for both correlation coefficient r value and the slope were mapped for each pixel and season. The results from the assessment of Model Skill in Simulating Observed Climate for the various seasons determined the models and seasons that were projected into the future using CORDEX RCA4.5 models. The three sub-periods used in the projections included the sub-periods up to 2030 (sub-period 1), up to 2050 (sub-period 2), and up to 2070 (sub-period 3). The results from model verification and climate change projections with CORDEX RCA4.5 models are independently highlighted in the following sections. The annual cycle of Gu (AMJ) and Deyr (SON) season rainfall for the baseline period 1960-90 from gridded CHIRPS observations and CORDEX RCMs simulated outputs were compared the study area in order to determine the best ensemble models that can be used for the future climate change rainfall projections. Future projections of temperature were undertaken for all the four standard seasons of the year. Figure 1(a) and Figure 1(b) illustrate the performance of CORDEX RCMs in simulating annual rainfall and temperature cycles over the study area as compared to the CHIRPS data. All of the RCMs capture fairly well the rainfall seasonality in Lower Jubba. Figure 1(a) shows that the north-south rainfall pattern follows the migration of the ITCZ, with associated locations of maximum rainfall being depicted fairly well by the ensemble model. For the study area, the ensemble mean results were found to simulate fairly well the annual rainfall cycle when compared to individual RCM models. In general, the study revealed some fairly good agreement between annual rainfall cycle simulated by ensemble of CORDEX RCMs and the CHIRPS data. The most notable shortcoming in most individual RCMs is the early peak and overestimation of the mean monthly rainfall particularly in the Deyr season (Figure 1(a)). Studies have shown that GCMs tend to overestimate rainfall in the Horn of Africa region during October to December season [2] [44] . IPCC reports have indicated limitation in the extent of skilful rainfall projection due to the nonlinear and chaotic nature of the climate system [2] . Results from the study showed that the ensemble models closely reproduced realistic representation of the observed climate features. Figure 1(b) shows the performance of CORDEX RCMs in simulating the mean surface temperature over Jubaland compared to the observed temperature data. The ensemble model seems to overestimate temperature when compared to the observed data during the hot months of Jan-April while underestimate during July to December, Figure 1(b). The results from the study indicated that the multi-model ensembles outperformed the individual RCM model as shown in Figure 2(a) and Figure 2(b). All of the RCMs however captured fairly well the rainfall seasonality in Lower Jubba, though significant biases can be found in individual models depending on the seasons as seen in Figure 2(a). The model bias for precipitation in each individual model varies from month to month. NOAA, CNRM and MPI and overestimated the rainfall data between August and November while MIROC underestimates the rainfall data in the same period. Figure 2(b) also showed variation in performance of the RCMs from month to month even with the temperature data. ICHEC underestimated the temperatures between January and June, while NOAA underestimated the data between July and December. MOCH and NCC overestimated the data in April. Similar results are from some previous studies for the Multi-model ensemble projections [2] [34] [35] [36] . It observed from the examination of the skill of the individual CORDEX models and ensemble models simulation observed CHIRPS and GEOCLIM data over the period 1961-1990 best during Gu (AMJ) season. Thus projection of future rainfall scenarios was undertaken for only the Gu (AMJ) season. The projections undertaken for temperature were observed for all seasons. It observed from the examination of the skill of the individual CORDEX models and ensemble models simulation observed CHIRPS and GEOCLIM data over the period 1961-1990 best during Gu (AMJ) season. Thus projection of future rainfall scenarios was undertaken for only the Gu (AMJ) season. The projections undertaken for temperature were observed for all seasons. The results for future projections of rainfall and temperature with the CORDEX RCMs are given below for IPCC sub periods of 2030, 2050 and 2070. The simulations of rainfall concentrated on the Gu (April-June) season, where most models showed more realistic simulations of rainfall. The geographical distribution exhibits notable spatial variability in rainfall over Lower Jubba. Badhaadhe district towards the southern coast exhibits the highest amount of rainfall as seen in Table 1. The southern costal region shows the highest projected amount of rainfall in Lower Jubba throughout all three sub-periods as was seen with the historical data published [20] . The patterns of the projected changes in seasonal ensemble mean Gu rainfall for the three sub-periods namely 2030, 2050 and 2070 showed significant variations in the magnitude of the projected seasonal rainfall from place to place, season, sub-periods and scenarios. There is a general increase in rainfall in Lower Jubba from 2030 to 2070. The projected rainfall is however not homogeneous throughout the region with the inland region receiving the least amount of rainfall. Similar results are reported in the Somali NAPA which shows an increase in rainfall in 2050 and 2080 [45] . This is also supported by IPCC studies that project an increase in MAM rainfall in 2050-2100 in most parts of Eastern Africa [2] . North eastern Kenya bordering Lower Jubba is projected to receive an increase in rainfall of 40% relative to the baseline period (1981-2010) by 2100 during its long rain season [46] . Table 1 shows the range of seasonal precipitation from the projected ensemble data for Gu, averaged over the districts in Jubaland, with RCP4.5 scenario for the three sub-periods 2030, 2050 and 2070. The observed trends of the temporal evolution of the projected precipitation over this region are shown in Figures 3(a)-(c). The results show a decreasing trend for the first sub-period Figure 3(a), followed by an increasing trend for the second and third sub-periods Figure 3(b) and Figure 3(c). The trends are however not statistically significant at a 95% confidence level. Despite being statistically insignificant the results are similar to those of studies over the region [1] [2] [47] . For Africa, IPCC projects that almost all countries except South Africa will probably experience a significant reduction in precipitation until 2050 which then increases significantly between 2050 and 2100 [2] corroborating the results displayed in Figures 3(a)-(c). The averaged mean water vapor, evaporation and precipitation are projected to increase globally by 2100 [1] [2] . The use of climate change knowledge, particularly when mainstreamed into planned policies and poverty reduction strategies can provide a starting point for the identification of climate risks at a district, regional and national level. The projected rainfall further shows dominant dry and wet phases of the Gu season in the future (Figure 4), which calls for sustained investment in early warning mechanisms, and water management systems. The spatial representation of the projected rainfall trends showed no homogenous patterns throughout the three study sub periods. While some areas in Lower Jubba are projected to have general decrease in rainfall during the long rain season, other areas were projected to have a general increase in rainfall (Table 2). General increasing trend was however seen throughout Lower Jubba, with different magnitude of the changes. Details of the pattern in the trend in each district can be seen in Table 2. Although the projected rainfall trends were still not statistically significant, the complexity of the observed characteristics of the changes continues to call for further studies and tailored mitigation and adaptation strategies over the region of study. Individual rainfall time series shown in Figure 5 further indicate general dominance of depressed rainfall during the sub period ending in 2030, followed with dominance of positive rainfall anomalies during the last two sub-periods ending in 2050 and 2070. These results signify the need for investment in early warning mechanisms in Lower Jubba. Results on Lower Jubba are similar to projected results for Africa, where the impacts of climate change will be exacerbated by widespread poverty, diseases and high population growth rates, which would intensify the demand for food, water and livestock [47] [48] . The projected recurrence of depressed rainfall for the near future is significant for a country that is already highly vulnerable with high poverty levels across multiple dimensions [49] . Somalia is already experiencing food insecurity, the implication of a further risk to food and water security could pause a threat on security in a struggle for available resources. Furthermore, results from this study have shown that communities in Lower Jubba revert to charcoal production when their livelihoods are threatened, the impact of which is forest degradation. The recurrence of extreme below normal rainfall often associated with drought is also evident, given the communities use of charcoal as an adaptation strategy, an increase in deforestation and degradation can be expected. The projected precipitation presented in this study call for urgency in finding short and mid-term solutions. The increase in above average rainfall associated with floods as seen in Figure 4 by in sub-period 2 (2050) is also consistent with Tierney, et al. and IPCC that projects increased precipitation in Africa generally during the same period [1] [2] [47] . The magnitude of the extreme above and below average rainfall for the projected future is not the same as seen in Figure 4. Similar results in the bordering regions in Kenya, project an increase in intensity of rainfall, and extreme rainfall events [46] . The spatial pattern of the projected seasonal ensemble mean surface temperature based on the RCMs are shown for the three sub-periods namely 2030, 2050 and 2070 relative to the baseline period showed general warming at most locations over the three sub periods ending in 2030, 2050 and 2070. Results however show that projected change in temperature will vary from season to season and district to district. Like the observed GISTEMP data [20], the average temperature seems to increase towards the southern costal band in all seasons, possibly due to influence by Indian Ocean [50] . The ensemble models however seemed to overestimate the temperature in JJA which according to the observed data [20] should register the lowest temperature. Results from the temperature time series (Figure 6) show an increasing temperatures in both the near to long term future. This is in line with global and regional reports that project an increase in the average temperature by 2030 and a further increase by 2050 [2] [24] [25] [44] [51] . Results are statistically significant at 95% confidence level. Changes in temperature and humidity are reportedly linked to increased vector borne diseases and helminthes infections [52] . This will also have far reaching implications on many socio-economic sectors. Figure 5 shows the anomalies in the projected temperature time series. Results are similar to IPCC [2] reports projecting more hot and fewer cold temperature extremes in most places as global mean temperatures increase in a seasonal time scale. Results showed the rate of increase in temperature by 0.3 to 0.7 degrees by 2035. The unique patterns of the temperature time series is the tendencies for the annual temperature extremes to be generally higher that the preceding years. WMO recent observations have shown such tendencies in the recent years for the annual mean temperature time series. In general, the projections for Lower Jubba indicated an increase in minimum and maximum temperatures in all seasons in the projection periods 2030, 2050 and 2070. Temperature projections are critical in the development of effective and realistic climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction strategies. The impact of an increasing temperature would be far reaching for most socio-economic sectors including community safety, water, food, energy, infrastructure, among others [26] [53] [54] . The projected temperature would also exacerbate health issues with heat related morbidity and mortality in Africa being projected to increase [26] [27] [53] [54] [55] . Studies have also projected that the geographical distribution of disease prone areas like Malaria will increase as climatic conditions change, creating more conducive conditions for new diseases to breed in areas that were previously disease free [53] [55] [56] [57] . Projected rainfall change patterns indicated significant increase in high rainfall extremes were exhibited in periods leading up to 2050 and 2070. In the case of temperature, the projections from all the models showed increase in minimum and maximum temperatures in all seasons and sub periods, like being observed temperature projection over other parts of the world. Most of livelihoods and the socio-economic activities in Somalia are dependent on water availability from rainfall. The 2030, 2050 and 2070 projected rainfall and temperature change scenarios show that Somalia future development and livelihoods in future will face increased threats of climate extremes unless effective climate smart adaptation systems form integral components of national development strategies. With the prolonging socio economic stability in the country, the development of the required community based effective climate smart adaptation systems will require support from global and regional partners. Efforts to achieve food security in Somalia have long been hampered by climate extremes such as floods and drought, as well as civil wars, political volatility, rapid population growth, among other miseries [4] [23] [58] [59] . Most of the socio-economic activities in Lower Jubba are rain dependent. Recurring drought and floods cause acute stress on a developing economy such as that of Lower Jubba. Flooding in Lower Jubba has been linked to RVF outbreaks which in the past has resulted in a ban in the export of livestock from Somalia and led to massive losses for communities and the Somali economy [60] [61] [62] . Rainfall variability, particularly the projected recurrence of below average extremes in the near future would also impact the rate of restoration of disturbed vegetation. Temperature anomalies indicate recurrences of positive anomalies within all the three projected periods except for OND where some negative anomalies were evident during the first projection period. Seasonal differences, in the observed temperature projections, were quite evident and are major issues that require more studies in order to develop effective and realistic climate change and disaster risk reduction strategies. Long term adaptation planning by the Jubaland Administration for Lower Jubba must take an integrated approach to both floods and drought for both the near, mid and far future. Investment in early warning systems for daily, monthly, seasonal and inter-annual prediction is critical for any effective adaptation strategy. Timely seasonal forecasts and drought monitoring is essential for drought risk reduction in Lower Jubba where livelihoods are closely intertwined with climate variability. The study further provides some important knowledge on rainfall variability and change over the Lower Jubba region that would contribute to the 6th IPCC assessment report on the state of regional climate change over Africa. The knowledge on the past, present and future rainfall patterns derived from this study is important in the development of any effective disaster risk reduction and climate change strategies of Somalia in supporting sustainable development goals, implementation of the Paris UNFCCC, Sendai disaster risk reduction, among other global, regional, national and community based resilience building frameworks.', 'summary': 'Keywords:  Increasing evidence is able to link climate change to major and minor threats to natural systems, threatening environmental, social and economic development [1] [2] .

Increase in temperature could also change the ecology of infectious diseases as well as increase temperature related mortality and morbidity of people and livestock [2] [26] [27] .

In Sub-Saharan Africa, vulnerability to climate change for local communities is increased because of their dependence on rain fed agriculture [3] [4] [5] [6] . Large populations in Somalia in particular have experienced severer impacts due to water stress as their livelihoods are dependent on access to water and pasture [7] [8] . 94% of nomadic populations in Somalia are reportedly living in poverty. Somaliaâ\x80\x99s long coastal line provides fishing livelihood systems threatened by unique marine systems that include Somalia ocean currents systems, tropical cyclones and before tropical cyclones. Somalia has seen an increase in frequency and intensity of floods and droughts with severe droughts in 2007/2008, 2011/2012, 2015/16/17 [9] . Climate induced displacement in Somalia continues to increase with UN listing the number of internally displaced persons due to drought between November 2016 and October 2017 at 943,000 [10] . Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (2015-2030) recognized the difficulty in achieving sustainable development without the development of climate smart systems. Climate change impacts are projected to slow down economic growth, making poverty reduction even more difficult, while prolonging existing poverty traps [2] . Climate change risks undermine the sustainability of basic livelihoods, threatening food security, health among other socio-economic impacts. Without proper adaptation measures, the projected increase in frequency and severity of weather and climate extremes will undermine the safety of ecosystems and health [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . The need to strengthen Somaliaâ\x80\x99s capacity to deal with disasters, such as the protracted droughts and floods that it continues to face, is critical [16] . The study attempted to provide projected rainfall and temperature change scenarios for Lower Jubba region, Somalia. This was done using the downscaled Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) RCMs data. The annual rainfall and temperature cycles simulated by an ensemble of CORDEX RCMs were compared with the observed data. The analysis focused on the Gu long rain season, which had the best agreement in comparison to the observed rainfall data. Projections for temperature were done for all the standard global climatological seasons namely northern hemisphere summer, winter, autumn and spring seasons that correspond to June to August, December to February, September to November, March to May months. The projections of the future Gu long rain season characteristics was done using the IPCC projected periods of 2030, 2050 and 2070 benchmarks. Lower Jubba is located in the Jubaland state of Somalia [17] [18] . Jubaland consists of the Gedo, Lower Jubba and Middle Jubba regions, and lies 40 - 60 km east of the Jubba River, stretching from Gedo to the Indian Ocean. The state of Jubaland borders the Garrisa, Wajir and Mandera County of Kenya on the western side. Kismayo, located in Lower Jubba, is the largest city in Jubaland, and the third largest city in Somalia after Mogadishu and Hargesa [19] . Lower Jubba receives about 350 mm rainfall during Gu (AMJ) season and an average of 250 mm Deyr (SON) season. Lower Jubba saw a general decreasing trend in rainfall during the Gu rainfall season, and a general increasing trend in the Deyr rainfall between 1981 to 2015 [20] . The Lower Jubba region has also experienced an increase in occurrence of depressed rainfall usually associated with drought, and a decrease in the frequency of above normal rainfall associated with floods [20] . Studies on the GHA show a decrease of MAM long rains and increase in the OND short rains [21] [22] [23] . Lower Jubba has seen increasing trends in the minimum, maximum and average temperature [20], consistent with the results from many recent studies worldwide [2] [24] [25] . Increase in temperature could also change the ecology of infectious diseases as well as increase temperature related mortality and morbidity of people and livestock [2] [26] [27] . Climate Change projections for Somalia will be used to derive information regarding the potential increase of the threats of climate extremes on future development and livelihoods. It will also enable the development of effective climate smart adaptation strategies. Details of area of study, data used and methodologies adopted are highlighted in the following sections. Gridded CHIRPS and GeoCLIM observations for the period 1960-90 were used as the baseline observations data. CHIRPS is a global dataset (50Ë\x9aS - 50Ë\x9aN, 180Ë\x9aE - 180Ë\x9aW), 0.05Ë\x9a resolution, 1981 to near-present gridded precipitation time series. CHIRPS data are produced by scientists at the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) Climate Hazard Group (CHG) and the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Earth Resources Observation and Science (EROS) Center. The data was developed to support the United States Agency for International Development Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET). Rainfall Measuring Mission Multi-satellite Precipitation Analysis version 7 (TMPA 3B42 v7) is used to calibrate global Cold Cloud Duration (CCD) rainfall estimates. Details on CHIRPS data and their usability in the region are well documented by ICPAC among many others [28] [29] . A coordinated set of the 20th and 21st century climate simulations for the Atmosphere Ocean coupled Global Climate Models (AOGCMs) in the Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5) have been contributed to by climate modelling groups from all around the world [30] . Data from the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) Africa framework was used in this study to project scenarios for precipitation in Lower Jubba. The CORDEX program is an initiative by World Climate Research Program (WCRP) of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) that generates high-resolution climate projections (50 km) for climate studies, within the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) timeline and beyond [31] [32] [33] . CORDEX data used in this study represented precipitation fairly well over the region and thus can be used to inform on adaptation and mitigation strategies [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] . These climate models describe the coupling of the atmosphere with the land surface, with differing dynamics and physics formulations [31] [37] . For each experiment the historical runs, forced by observed natural and anthropogenic atmospheric composition, cover the period from 1950-2005. The future projections (2006-2100) are forced with two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP), namely; RCP4.5 (mid-range emissions) and RCP8.5 (high-end emissions) scenarios, which prescribe future atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations and aerosols. Detail on the CORDEX RCMs can be found in Endris [32] and Nikulin [33] . Endris [32] evaluated the ability of the CORDEX RCMs in simulating the general characteristics of the climate over Eastern Africa region by analyzing the annual cycle, spatial variability, pattern correlation and root mean square error using a Taylor diagram. The study found that these RCMs reasonably simulate the main features of the rainfall climatology over eastern Africa and also reproduce the majority of the documented regional responses to ENSO and IOD forcings. At the same time the analysis showed significant biases in individual models depending on sub-region and season; however, the ensemble mean had better agreement with observation than individual models. The analysis concluded that the multi-model ensemble mean simulates eastern Africa rainfall adequately and could therefore be used for the assessment of future climate projections for the region. The CORDEX RCMs data was obtained from IGAD Climate Prediction and Application Centre (ICPAC) which is the WMO regional climate center for the Greater Horn of Africa. In this study the region of interest was Lower Jubba that is bounded by latitudes 1.5Ë\x9aS - 12.0Ë\x9aN and longitudes 41.0Ë\x9aE - 51.0Ë\x9aE. There IPCC based climate projection reference period were used namely 2030 (sub-period 1), sub-period up to 2050 (sub-period 2), and sub-period up to 2070 (sub-period 3). The study was divided into two major sections namely assessment of Model Skill in Simulating Observed Climate during the period 1961-1990, and the projection of future rainfall and temperature scenarios. Standard methods were adopted to determine the best climate model/s that could be used for the projection of future climate change scenarios for Lower Jubba region of Somalia for the two standard rainfall seasons Gu (April to June) and Deyr (September to November). The temperature simulations were for all standard seasons of the year in Somalia namely December-February (DJF), March-May (MAM), July-August (JJA), and September-November (SON). Standard methods were also adopted to test the spatial and temporal bias of the individual models. The methods used included various time series methods, correlation and regression analysis. Correlation methods examined correlations between the observed and simulated outputs at specific grid point locations. The square of the correlation coefficient is knows as coefficient of determination (r2) which represented the variance of the observed data that could be accounted for by the predicted variable. Regression method attempted to fit the best linear mathematical equation for the observed relationships. The statistical significance of the fitted linear regression trends were examined using graphical approaches as well as the standards statistical test that include the use of Mann-Kendall Rank Statistics. Similar methods have been adopted in many studies in Africa and the world at large [6] [20] [22] [24] [38] [39] [40] . A linear regression trend was investigated by examining the relationship between time (T) and the variable of interest (X), in this case rainfall, using the following equation X(t) is the individual observed seasonal rainfall/temperature during the baseline period 1960-1990, while Y(t) are corresponding values simulated by the individual CORDEX models over the period 1961-1990, c and b are normally the intercept and gradient (slope) of the regression equation. The slope indicates the average rate of change in the dependent variable in each year of the given time period. A positive/negative slope shows an increasing/decreasing trend respectively. The limitation of this method is that it assumes that all linkages between observed and CORDEX models generated models are linear, and the distributions of the observed and predicted records are normal. For non-normal data the study included nonparametric tests namely the Mann-Kendall rank statistics method was used. In the Mann-Kendall analysis data is ranked after being placed in time sequential order. The time series values (X1, X2, X3, X4 â\x80¦, Xn) where X in this case represents rainfall are replaced by their relative ranks (R1, R2, R3, R4 â\x80¦, Rn) (starting from the lowest value up to n). The relative magnitudes of sample data is compared rather than the data values themselves [41] [42] [43] . The equation used is as follows, where S is the Kendall score given a dataset R with a sample size of n values. The Kendall statistics s is given in Equation (2) below based on Kendall, 1938; 1945; 1948 The observed trend is significant if s values in Equation (2) have significance levels equal or less than 0.5. The ensemble model data was used in this study to compute the correlation value r and linear trend lines for each pixel for the individual seasons. The results for both correlation coefficient r value and the slope were mapped for each pixel and season. The results from the assessment of Model Skill in Simulating Observed Climate for the various seasons determined the models and seasons that were projected into the future using CORDEX RCA4.5 models. The three sub-periods used in the projections included the sub-periods up to 2030 (sub-period 1), up to 2050 (sub-period 2), and up to 2070 (sub-period 3). The results from model verification and climate change projections with CORDEX RCA4.5 models are independently highlighted in the following sections. The annual cycle of Gu (AMJ) and Deyr (SON) season rainfall for the baseline period 1960-90 from gridded CHIRPS observations and CORDEX RCMs simulated outputs were compared the study area in order to determine the best ensemble models that can be used for the future climate change rainfall projections. Future projections of temperature were undertaken for all the four standard seasons of the year. Figure 1(a) and Figure 1(b) illustrate the performance of CORDEX RCMs in simulating annual rainfall and temperature cycles over the study area as compared to the CHIRPS data. All of the RCMs capture fairly well the rainfall seasonality in Lower Jubba. Figure 1(a) shows that the north-south rainfall pattern follows the migration of the ITCZ, with associated locations of maximum rainfall being depicted fairly well by the ensemble model. For the study area, the ensemble mean results were found to simulate fairly well the annual rainfall cycle when compared to individual RCM models. In general, the study revealed some fairly good agreement between annual rainfall cycle simulated by ensemble of CORDEX RCMs and the CHIRPS data. The most notable shortcoming in most individual RCMs is the early peak and overestimation of the mean monthly rainfall particularly in the Deyr season (Figure 1(a)). Studies have shown that GCMs tend to overestimate rainfall in the Horn of Africa region during October to December season [2] [44] . IPCC reports have indicated limitation in the extent of skilful rainfall projection due to the nonlinear and chaotic nature of the climate system [2] . Results from the study showed that the ensemble models closely reproduced realistic representation of the observed climate features. Figure 1(b) shows the performance of CORDEX RCMs in simulating the mean surface temperature over Jubaland compared to the observed temperature data. The ensemble model seems to overestimate temperature when compared to the observed data during the hot months of Jan-April while underestimate during July to December, Figure 1(b). The results from the study indicated that the multi-model ensembles outperformed the individual RCM model as shown in Figure 2(a) and Figure 2(b). All of the RCMs however captured fairly well the rainfall seasonality in Lower Jubba, though significant biases can be found in individual models depending on the seasons as seen in Figure 2(a). The model bias for precipitation in each individual model varies from month to month. NOAA, CNRM and MPI and overestimated the rainfall data between August and November while MIROC underestimates the rainfall data in the same period. Figure 2(b) also showed variation in performance of the RCMs from month to month even with the temperature data. ICHEC underestimated the temperatures between January and June, while NOAA underestimated the data between July and December. MOCH and NCC overestimated the data in April. Similar results are from some previous studies for the Multi-model ensemble projections [2] [34] [35] [36] . It observed from the examination of the skill of the individual CORDEX models and ensemble models simulation observed CHIRPS and GEOCLIM data over the period 1961-1990 best during Gu (AMJ) season. Thus projection of future rainfall scenarios was undertaken for only the Gu (AMJ) season. The projections undertaken for temperature were observed for all seasons. It observed from the examination of the skill of the individual CORDEX models and ensemble models simulation observed CHIRPS and GEOCLIM data over the period 1961-1990 best during Gu (AMJ) season. Thus projection of future rainfall scenarios was undertaken for only the Gu (AMJ) season. The projections undertaken for temperature were observed for all seasons. The results for future projections of rainfall and temperature with the CORDEX RCMs are given below for IPCC sub periods of 2030, 2050 and 2070. The simulations of rainfall concentrated on the Gu (April-June) season, where most models showed more realistic simulations of rainfall. The geographical distribution exhibits notable spatial variability in rainfall over Lower Jubba. Badhaadhe district towards the southern coast exhibits the highest amount of rainfall as seen in Table 1. The southern costal region shows the highest projected amount of rainfall in Lower Jubba throughout all three sub-periods as was seen with the historical data published [20] . The patterns of the projected changes in seasonal ensemble mean Gu rainfall for the three sub-periods namely 2030, 2050 and 2070 showed significant variations in the magnitude of the projected seasonal rainfall from place to place, season, sub-periods and scenarios. There is a general increase in rainfall in Lower Jubba from 2030 to 2070. The projected rainfall is however not homogeneous throughout the region with the inland region receiving the least amount of rainfall. Similar results are reported in the Somali NAPA which shows an increase in rainfall in 2050 and 2080 [45] . This is also supported by IPCC studies that project an increase in MAM rainfall in 2050-2100 in most parts of Eastern Africa [2] . North eastern Kenya bordering Lower Jubba is projected to receive an increase in rainfall of 40% relative to the baseline period (1981-2010) by 2100 during its long rain season [46] . Table 1 shows the range of seasonal precipitation from the projected ensemble data for Gu, averaged over the districts in Jubaland, with RCP4.5 scenario for the three sub-periods 2030, 2050 and 2070. The observed trends of the temporal evolution of the projected precipitation over this region are shown in Figures 3(a)-(c). The results show a decreasing trend for the first sub-period Figure 3(a), followed by an increasing trend for the second and third sub-periods Figure 3(b) and Figure 3(c). The trends are however not statistically significant at a 95% confidence level. Despite being statistically insignificant the results are similar to those of studies over the region [1] [2] [47] . For Africa, IPCC projects that almost all countries except South Africa will probably experience a significant reduction in precipitation until 2050 which then increases significantly between 2050 and 2100 [2] corroborating the results displayed in Figures 3(a)-(c). The averaged mean water vapor, evaporation and precipitation are projected to increase globally by 2100 [1] [2] . The use of climate change knowledge, particularly when mainstreamed into planned policies and poverty reduction strategies can provide a starting point for the identification of climate risks at a district, regional and national level. The projected rainfall further shows dominant dry and wet phases of the Gu season in the future (Figure 4), which calls for sustained investment in early warning mechanisms, and water management systems. The spatial representation of the projected rainfall trends showed no homogenous patterns throughout the three study sub periods. While some areas in Lower Jubba are projected to have general decrease in rainfall during the long rain season, other areas were projected to have a general increase in rainfall (Table 2). General increasing trend was however seen throughout Lower Jubba, with different magnitude of the changes. Details of the pattern in the trend in each district can be seen in Table 2. Although the projected rainfall trends were still not statistically significant, the complexity of the observed characteristics of the changes continues to call for further studies and tailored mitigation and adaptation strategies over the region of study. Individual rainfall time series shown in Figure 5 further indicate general dominance of depressed rainfall during the sub period ending in 2030, followed with dominance of positive rainfall anomalies during the last two sub-periods ending in 2050 and 2070. These results signify the need for investment in early warning mechanisms in Lower Jubba. Results on Lower Jubba are similar to projected results for Africa, where the impacts of climate change will be exacerbated by widespread poverty, diseases and high population growth rates, which would intensify the demand for food, water and livestock [47] [48] . The projected recurrence of depressed rainfall for the near future is significant for a country that is already highly vulnerable with high poverty levels across multiple dimensions [49] . Somalia is already experiencing food insecurity, the implication of a further risk to food and water security could pause a threat on security in a struggle for available resources. Furthermore, results from this study have shown that communities in Lower Jubba revert to charcoal production when their livelihoods are threatened, the impact of which is forest degradation. The recurrence of extreme below normal rainfall often associated with drought is also evident, given the communities use of charcoal as an adaptation strategy, an increase in deforestation and degradation can be expected. The projected precipitation presented in this study call for urgency in finding short and mid-term solutions. The increase in above average rainfall associated with floods as seen in Figure 4 by in sub-period 2 (2050) is also consistent with Tierney, et al. and IPCC that projects increased precipitation in Africa generally during the same period [1] [2] [47] . The magnitude of the extreme above and below average rainfall for the projected future is not the same as seen in Figure 4. Similar results in the bordering regions in Kenya, project an increase in intensity of rainfall, and extreme rainfall events [46] . The spatial pattern of the projected seasonal ensemble mean surface temperature based on the RCMs are shown for the three sub-periods namely 2030, 2050 and 2070 relative to the baseline period showed general warming at most locations over the three sub periods ending in 2030, 2050 and 2070. Results however show that projected change in temperature will vary from season to season and district to district. Like the observed GISTEMP data [20], the average temperature seems to increase towards the southern costal band in all seasons, possibly due to influence by Indian Ocean [50] . The ensemble models however seemed to overestimate the temperature in JJA which according to the observed data [20] should register the lowest temperature. Results from the temperature time series (Figure 6) show an increasing temperatures in both the near to long term future. This is in line with global and regional reports that project an increase in the average temperature by 2030 and a further increase by 2050 [2] [24] [25] [44] [51] . Results are statistically significant at 95% confidence level. Changes in temperature and humidity are reportedly linked to increased vector borne diseases and helminthes infections [52] . This will also have far reaching implications on many socio-economic sectors. Figure 5 shows the anomalies in the projected temperature time series. Results are similar to IPCC [2] reports projecting more hot and fewer cold temperature extremes in most places as global mean temperatures increase in a seasonal time scale. Results showed the rate of increase in temperature by 0.3 to 0.7 degrees by 2035. The unique patterns of the temperature time series is the tendencies for the annual temperature extremes to be generally higher that the preceding years. WMO recent observations have shown such tendencies in the recent years for the annual mean temperature time series. In general, the projections for Lower Jubba indicated an increase in minimum and maximum temperatures in all seasons in the projection periods 2030, 2050 and 2070. Temperature projections are critical in the development of effective and realistic climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction strategies. The impact of an increasing temperature would be far reaching for most socio-economic sectors including community safety, water, food, energy, infrastructure, among others [26] [53] [54] . The projected temperature would also exacerbate health issues with heat related morbidity and mortality in Africa being projected to increase [26] [27] [53] [54] [55] . Studies have also projected that the geographical distribution of disease prone areas like Malaria will increase as climatic conditions change, creating more conducive conditions for new diseases to breed in areas that were previously disease free [53] [55] [56] [57] . Projected rainfall change patterns indicated significant increase in high rainfall extremes were exhibited in periods leading up to 2050 and 2070. In the case of temperature, the projections from all the models showed increase in minimum and maximum temperatures in all seasons and sub periods, like being observed temperature projection over other parts of the world. Most of livelihoods and the socio-economic activities in Somalia are dependent on water availability from rainfall. The 2030, 2050 and 2070 projected rainfall and temperature change scenarios show that Somalia future development and livelihoods in future will face increased threats of climate extremes unless effective climate smart adaptation systems form integral components of national development strategies. With the prolonging socio economic stability in the country, the development of the required community based effective climate smart adaptation systems will require support from global and regional partners. Efforts to achieve food security in Somalia have long been hampered by climate extremes such as floods and drought, as well as civil wars, political volatility, rapid population growth, among other miseries [4] [23] [58] [59] . Most of the socio-economic activities in Lower Jubba are rain dependent. Recurring drought and floods cause acute stress on a developing economy such as that of Lower Jubba. Flooding in Lower Jubba has been linked to RVF outbreaks which in the past has resulted in a ban in the export of livestock from Somalia and led to massive losses for communities and the Somali economy [60] [61] [62] . Rainfall variability, particularly the projected recurrence of below average extremes in the near future would also impact the rate of restoration of disturbed vegetation. Temperature anomalies indicate recurrences of positive anomalies within all the three projected periods except for OND where some negative anomalies were evident during the first projection period. Seasonal differences, in the observed temperature projections, were quite evident and are major issues that require more studies in order to develop effective and realistic climate change and disaster risk reduction strategies. Long term adaptation planning by the Jubaland Administration for Lower Jubba must take an integrated approach to both floods and drought for both the near, mid and far future. Investment in early warning systems for daily, monthly, seasonal and inter-annual prediction is critical for any effective adaptation strategy. Timely seasonal forecasts and drought monitoring is essential for drought risk reduction in Lower Jubba where livelihoods are closely intertwined with climate variability. The study further provides some important knowledge on rainfall variability and change over the Lower Jubba region that would contribute to the 6th IPCC assessment report on the state of regional climate change over Africa. The knowledge on the past, present and future rainfall patterns derived from this study is important in the development of any effective disaster risk reduction and climate change strategies of Somalia in supporting sustainable development goals, implementation of the Paris UNFCCC, Sendai disaster risk reduction, among other global, regional, national and community based resilience building frameworks.', 'summary': 'Keywords:  Increasing evidence is able to link climate change to major and minor threats to natural systems, threatening environmental, social and economic development [1] [2] . Climate change impacts are projected to slow down economic growth, making poverty reduction even more difficult, while prolonging existing poverty traps [2] . Increase in temperature could also change the ecology of infectious diseases as well as increase temperature related mortality and morbidity of people and livestock [2] [26] [27] .

In Sub-Saharan Africa, vulnerability to climate change for local communities is increased because of their dependence on rain fed agriculture [3] [4] [5] [6] . Large populations in Somalia in particular have experienced severer impacts due to water stress as their livelihoods are dependent on access to water and pasture [7] [8] . 94% of nomadic populations in Somalia are reportedly living in poverty. Somaliaâ\x80\x99s long coastal line provides fishing livelihood systems threatened by unique marine systems that include Somalia ocean currents systems, tropical cyclones and before tropical cyclones. Somalia has seen an increase in frequency and intensity of floods and droughts with severe droughts in 2007/2008, 2011/2012, 2015/16/17 [9] . Climate induced displacement in Somalia continues to increase with UN listing the number of internally displaced persons due to drought between November 2016 and October 2017 at 943,000 [10] . Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (2015-2030) recognized the difficulty in achieving sustainable development without the development of climate smart systems. Climate change impacts are projected to slow down economic growth, making poverty reduction even more difficult, while prolonging existing poverty traps [2] . Climate change risks undermine the sustainability of basic livelihoods, threatening food security, health among other socio-economic impacts. Without proper adaptation measures, the projected increase in frequency and severity of weather and climate extremes will undermine the safety of ecosystems and health [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . The need to strengthen Somaliaâ\x80\x99s capacity to deal with disasters, such as the protracted droughts and floods that it continues to face, is critical [16] . The study attempted to provide projected rainfall and temperature change scenarios for Lower Jubba region, Somalia. This was done using the downscaled Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) RCMs data. The annual rainfall and temperature cycles simulated by an ensemble of CORDEX RCMs were compared with the observed data. The analysis focused on the Gu long rain season, which had the best agreement in comparison to the observed rainfall data. Projections for temperature were done for all the standard global climatological seasons namely northern hemisphere summer, winter, autumn and spring seasons that correspond to June to August, December to February, September to November, March to May months. The projections of the future Gu long rain season characteristics was done using the IPCC projected periods of 2030, 2050 and 2070 benchmarks. Lower Jubba is located in the Jubaland state of Somalia [17] [18] . Jubaland consists of the Gedo, Lower Jubba and Middle Jubba regions, and lies 40 - 60 km east of the Jubba River, stretching from Gedo to the Indian Ocean. The state of Jubaland borders the Garrisa, Wajir and Mandera County of Kenya on the western side. Kismayo, located in Lower Jubba, is the largest city in Jubaland, and the third largest city in Somalia after Mogadishu and Hargesa [19] . Lower Jubba receives about 350 mm rainfall during Gu (AMJ) season and an average of 250 mm Deyr (SON) season. Lower Jubba saw a general decreasing trend in rainfall during the Gu rainfall season, and a general increasing trend in the Deyr rainfall between 1981 to 2015 [20] . The Lower Jubba region has also experienced an increase in occurrence of depressed rainfall usually associated with drought, and a decrease in the frequency of above normal rainfall associated with floods [20] . Studies on the GHA show a decrease of MAM long rains and increase in the OND short rains [21] [22] [23] . Lower Jubba has seen increasing trends in the minimum, maximum and average temperature [20], consistent with the results from many recent studies worldwide [2] [24] [25] . Increase in temperature could also change the ecology of infectious diseases as well as increase temperature related mortality and morbidity of people and livestock [2] [26] [27] . Climate Change projections for Somalia will be used to derive information regarding the potential increase of the threats of climate extremes on future development and livelihoods. It will also enable the development of effective climate smart adaptation strategies. Details of area of study, data used and methodologies adopted are highlighted in the following sections. Gridded CHIRPS and GeoCLIM observations for the period 1960-90 were used as the baseline observations data. CHIRPS is a global dataset (50Ë\x9aS - 50Ë\x9aN, 180Ë\x9aE - 180Ë\x9aW), 0.05Ë\x9a resolution, 1981 to near-present gridded precipitation time series. CHIRPS data are produced by scientists at the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) Climate Hazard Group (CHG) and the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Earth Resources Observation and Science (EROS) Center. The data was developed to support the United States Agency for International Development Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET). Rainfall Measuring Mission Multi-satellite Precipitation Analysis version 7 (TMPA 3B42 v7) is used to calibrate global Cold Cloud Duration (CCD) rainfall estimates. Details on CHIRPS data and their usability in the region are well documented by ICPAC among many others [28] [29] . A coordinated set of the 20th and 21st century climate simulations for the Atmosphere Ocean coupled Global Climate Models (AOGCMs) in the Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5) have been contributed to by climate modelling groups from all around the world [30] . Data from the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) Africa framework was used in this study to project scenarios for precipitation in Lower Jubba. The CORDEX program is an initiative by World Climate Research Program (WCRP) of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) that generates high-resolution climate projections (50 km) for climate studies, within the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) timeline and beyond [31] [32] [33] . CORDEX data used in this study represented precipitation fairly well over the region and thus can be used to inform on adaptation and mitigation strategies [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] . These climate models describe the coupling of the atmosphere with the land surface, with differing dynamics and physics formulations [31] [37] . For each experiment the historical runs, forced by observed natural and anthropogenic atmospheric composition, cover the period from 1950-2005. The future projections (2006-2100) are forced with two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP), namely; RCP4.5 (mid-range emissions) and RCP8.5 (high-end emissions) scenarios, which prescribe future atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations and aerosols. Detail on the CORDEX RCMs can be found in Endris [32] and Nikulin [33] . Endris [32] evaluated the ability of the CORDEX RCMs in simulating the general characteristics of the climate over Eastern Africa region by analyzing the annual cycle, spatial variability, pattern correlation and root mean square error using a Taylor diagram. The study found that these RCMs reasonably simulate the main features of the rainfall climatology over eastern Africa and also reproduce the majority of the documented regional responses to ENSO and IOD forcings. At the same time the analysis showed significant biases in individual models depending on sub-region and season; however, the ensemble mean had better agreement with observation than individual models. The analysis concluded that the multi-model ensemble mean simulates eastern Africa rainfall adequately and could therefore be used for the assessment of future climate projections for the region. The CORDEX RCMs data was obtained from IGAD Climate Prediction and Application Centre (ICPAC) which is the WMO regional climate center for the Greater Horn of Africa. In this study the region of interest was Lower Jubba that is bounded by latitudes 1.5Ë\x9aS - 12.0Ë\x9aN and longitudes 41.0Ë\x9aE - 51.0Ë\x9aE. There IPCC based climate projection reference period were used namely 2030 (sub-period 1), sub-period up to 2050 (sub-period 2), and sub-period up to 2070 (sub-period 3). The study was divided into two major sections namely assessment of Model Skill in Simulating Observed Climate during the period 1961-1990, and the projection of future rainfall and temperature scenarios. Standard methods were adopted to determine the best climate model/s that could be used for the projection of future climate change scenarios for Lower Jubba region of Somalia for the two standard rainfall seasons Gu (April to June) and Deyr (September to November). The temperature simulations were for all standard seasons of the year in Somalia namely December-February (DJF), March-May (MAM), July-August (JJA), and September-November (SON). Standard methods were also adopted to test the spatial and temporal bias of the individual models. The methods used included various time series methods, correlation and regression analysis. Correlation methods examined correlations between the observed and simulated outputs at specific grid point locations. The square of the correlation coefficient is knows as coefficient of determination (r2) which represented the variance of the observed data that could be accounted for by the predicted variable. Regression method attempted to fit the best linear mathematical equation for the observed relationships. The statistical significance of the fitted linear regression trends were examined using graphical approaches as well as the standards statistical test that include the use of Mann-Kendall Rank Statistics. Similar methods have been adopted in many studies in Africa and the world at large [6] [20] [22] [24] [38] [39] [40] . A linear regression trend was investigated by examining the relationship between time (T) and the variable of interest (X), in this case rainfall, using the following equation X(t) is the individual observed seasonal rainfall/temperature during the baseline period 1960-1990, while Y(t) are corresponding values simulated by the individual CORDEX models over the period 1961-1990, c and b are normally the intercept and gradient (slope) of the regression equation. The slope indicates the average rate of change in the dependent variable in each year of the given time period. A positive/negative slope shows an increasing/decreasing trend respectively. The limitation of this method is that it assumes that all linkages between observed and CORDEX models generated models are linear, and the distributions of the observed and predicted records are normal. For non-normal data the study included nonparametric tests namely the Mann-Kendall rank statistics method was used. In the Mann-Kendall analysis data is ranked after being placed in time sequential order. The time series values (X1, X2, X3, X4 â\x80¦, Xn) where X in this case represents rainfall are replaced by their relative ranks (R1, R2, R3, R4 â\x80¦, Rn) (starting from the lowest value up to n). The relative magnitudes of sample data is compared rather than the data values themselves [41] [42] [43] . The equation used is as follows, where S is the Kendall score given a dataset R with a sample size of n values. The Kendall statistics s is given in Equation (2) below based on Kendall, 1938; 1945; 1948 The observed trend is significant if s values in Equation (2) have significance levels equal or less than 0.5. The ensemble model data was used in this study to compute the correlation value r and linear trend lines for each pixel for the individual seasons. The results for both correlation coefficient r value and the slope were mapped for each pixel and season. The results from the assessment of Model Skill in Simulating Observed Climate for the various seasons determined the models and seasons that were projected into the future using CORDEX RCA4.5 models. The three sub-periods used in the projections included the sub-periods up to 2030 (sub-period 1), up to 2050 (sub-period 2), and up to 2070 (sub-period 3). The results from model verification and climate change projections with CORDEX RCA4.5 models are independently highlighted in the following sections. The annual cycle of Gu (AMJ) and Deyr (SON) season rainfall for the baseline period 1960-90 from gridded CHIRPS observations and CORDEX RCMs simulated outputs were compared the study area in order to determine the best ensemble models that can be used for the future climate change rainfall projections. Future projections of temperature were undertaken for all the four standard seasons of the year. Figure 1(a) and Figure 1(b) illustrate the performance of CORDEX RCMs in simulating annual rainfall and temperature cycles over the study area as compared to the CHIRPS data. All of the RCMs capture fairly well the rainfall seasonality in Lower Jubba. Figure 1(a) shows that the north-south rainfall pattern follows the migration of the ITCZ, with associated locations of maximum rainfall being depicted fairly well by the ensemble model. For the study area, the ensemble mean results were found to simulate fairly well the annual rainfall cycle when compared to individual RCM models. In general, the study revealed some fairly good agreement between annual rainfall cycle simulated by ensemble of CORDEX RCMs and the CHIRPS data. The most notable shortcoming in most individual RCMs is the early peak and overestimation of the mean monthly rainfall particularly in the Deyr season (Figure 1(a)). Studies have shown that GCMs tend to overestimate rainfall in the Horn of Africa region during October to December season [2] [44] . IPCC reports have indicated limitation in the extent of skilful rainfall projection due to the nonlinear and chaotic nature of the climate system [2] . Results from the study showed that the ensemble models closely reproduced realistic representation of the observed climate features. Figure 1(b) shows the performance of CORDEX RCMs in simulating the mean surface temperature over Jubaland compared to the observed temperature data. The ensemble model seems to overestimate temperature when compared to the observed data during the hot months of Jan-April while underestimate during July to December, Figure 1(b). The results from the study indicated that the multi-model ensembles outperformed the individual RCM model as shown in Figure 2(a) and Figure 2(b). All of the RCMs however captured fairly well the rainfall seasonality in Lower Jubba, though significant biases can be found in individual models depending on the seasons as seen in Figure 2(a). The model bias for precipitation in each individual model varies from month to month. NOAA, CNRM and MPI and overestimated the rainfall data between August and November while MIROC underestimates the rainfall data in the same period. Figure 2(b) also showed variation in performance of the RCMs from month to month even with the temperature data. ICHEC underestimated the temperatures between January and June, while NOAA underestimated the data between July and December. MOCH and NCC overestimated the data in April. Similar results are from some previous studies for the Multi-model ensemble projections [2] [34] [35] [36] . It observed from the examination of the skill of the individual CORDEX models and ensemble models simulation observed CHIRPS and GEOCLIM data over the period 1961-1990 best during Gu (AMJ) season. Thus projection of future rainfall scenarios was undertaken for only the Gu (AMJ) season. The projections undertaken for temperature were observed for all seasons. It observed from the examination of the skill of the individual CORDEX models and ensemble models simulation observed CHIRPS and GEOCLIM data over the period 1961-1990 best during Gu (AMJ) season. Thus projection of future rainfall scenarios was undertaken for only the Gu (AMJ) season. The projections undertaken for temperature were observed for all seasons. The results for future projections of rainfall and temperature with the CORDEX RCMs are given below for IPCC sub periods of 2030, 2050 and 2070. The simulations of rainfall concentrated on the Gu (April-June) season, where most models showed more realistic simulations of rainfall. The geographical distribution exhibits notable spatial variability in rainfall over Lower Jubba. Badhaadhe district towards the southern coast exhibits the highest amount of rainfall as seen in Table 1. The southern costal region shows the highest projected amount of rainfall in Lower Jubba throughout all three sub-periods as was seen with the historical data published [20] . The patterns of the projected changes in seasonal ensemble mean Gu rainfall for the three sub-periods namely 2030, 2050 and 2070 showed significant variations in the magnitude of the projected seasonal rainfall from place to place, season, sub-periods and scenarios. There is a general increase in rainfall in Lower Jubba from 2030 to 2070. The projected rainfall is however not homogeneous throughout the region with the inland region receiving the least amount of rainfall. Similar results are reported in the Somali NAPA which shows an increase in rainfall in 2050 and 2080 [45] . This is also supported by IPCC studies that project an increase in MAM rainfall in 2050-2100 in most parts of Eastern Africa [2] . North eastern Kenya bordering Lower Jubba is projected to receive an increase in rainfall of 40% relative to the baseline period (1981-2010) by 2100 during its long rain season [46] . Table 1 shows the range of seasonal precipitation from the projected ensemble data for Gu, averaged over the districts in Jubaland, with RCP4.5 scenario for the three sub-periods 2030, 2050 and 2070. The observed trends of the temporal evolution of the projected precipitation over this region are shown in Figures 3(a)-(c). The results show a decreasing trend for the first sub-period Figure 3(a), followed by an increasing trend for the second and third sub-periods Figure 3(b) and Figure 3(c). The trends are however not statistically significant at a 95% confidence level. Despite being statistically insignificant the results are similar to those of studies over the region [1] [2] [47] . For Africa, IPCC projects that almost all countries except South Africa will probably experience a significant reduction in precipitation until 2050 which then increases significantly between 2050 and 2100 [2] corroborating the results displayed in Figures 3(a)-(c). The averaged mean water vapor, evaporation and precipitation are projected to increase globally by 2100 [1] [2] . The use of climate change knowledge, particularly when mainstreamed into planned policies and poverty reduction strategies can provide a starting point for the identification of climate risks at a district, regional and national level. The projected rainfall further shows dominant dry and wet phases of the Gu season in the future (Figure 4), which calls for sustained investment in early warning mechanisms, and water management systems. The spatial representation of the projected rainfall trends showed no homogenous patterns throughout the three study sub periods. While some areas in Lower Jubba are projected to have general decrease in rainfall during the long rain season, other areas were projected to have a general increase in rainfall (Table 2). General increasing trend was however seen throughout Lower Jubba, with different magnitude of the changes. Details of the pattern in the trend in each district can be seen in Table 2. Although the projected rainfall trends were still not statistically significant, the complexity of the observed characteristics of the changes continues to call for further studies and tailored mitigation and adaptation strategies over the region of study. Individual rainfall time series shown in Figure 5 further indicate general dominance of depressed rainfall during the sub period ending in 2030, followed with dominance of positive rainfall anomalies during the last two sub-periods ending in 2050 and 2070. These results signify the need for investment in early warning mechanisms in Lower Jubba. Results on Lower Jubba are similar to projected results for Africa, where the impacts of climate change will be exacerbated by widespread poverty, diseases and high population growth rates, which would intensify the demand for food, water and livestock [47] [48] . The projected recurrence of depressed rainfall for the near future is significant for a country that is already highly vulnerable with high poverty levels across multiple dimensions [49] . Somalia is already experiencing food insecurity, the implication of a further risk to food and water security could pause a threat on security in a struggle for available resources. Furthermore, results from this study have shown that communities in Lower Jubba revert to charcoal production when their livelihoods are threatened, the impact of which is forest degradation. The recurrence of extreme below normal rainfall often associated with drought is also evident, given the communities use of charcoal as an adaptation strategy, an increase in deforestation and degradation can be expected. The projected precipitation presented in this study call for urgency in finding short and mid-term solutions. The increase in above average rainfall associated with floods as seen in Figure 4 by in sub-period 2 (2050) is also consistent with Tierney, et al. and IPCC that projects increased precipitation in Africa generally during the same period [1] [2] [47] . The magnitude of the extreme above and below average rainfall for the projected future is not the same as seen in Figure 4. Similar results in the bordering regions in Kenya, project an increase in intensity of rainfall, and extreme rainfall events [46] . The spatial pattern of the projected seasonal ensemble mean surface temperature based on the RCMs are shown for the three sub-periods namely 2030, 2050 and 2070 relative to the baseline period showed general warming at most locations over the three sub periods ending in 2030, 2050 and 2070. Results however show that projected change in temperature will vary from season to season and district to district. Like the observed GISTEMP data [20], the average temperature seems to increase towards the southern costal band in all seasons, possibly due to influence by Indian Ocean [50] . The ensemble models however seemed to overestimate the temperature in JJA which according to the observed data [20] should register the lowest temperature. Results from the temperature time series (Figure 6) show an increasing temperatures in both the near to long term future. This is in line with global and regional reports that project an increase in the average temperature by 2030 and a further increase by 2050 [2] [24] [25] [44] [51] . Results are statistically significant at 95% confidence level. Changes in temperature and humidity are reportedly linked to increased vector borne diseases and helminthes infections [52] . This will also have far reaching implications on many socio-economic sectors. Figure 5 shows the anomalies in the projected temperature time series. Results are similar to IPCC [2] reports projecting more hot and fewer cold temperature extremes in most places as global mean temperatures increase in a seasonal time scale. Results showed the rate of increase in temperature by 0.3 to 0.7 degrees by 2035. The unique patterns of the temperature time series is the tendencies for the annual temperature extremes to be generally higher that the preceding years. WMO recent observations have shown such tendencies in the recent years for the annual mean temperature time series. In general, the projections for Lower Jubba indicated an increase in minimum and maximum temperatures in all seasons in the projection periods 2030, 2050 and 2070. Temperature projections are critical in the development of effective and realistic climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction strategies. The impact of an increasing temperature would be far reaching for most socio-economic sectors including community safety, water, food, energy, infrastructure, among others [26] [53] [54] . The projected temperature would also exacerbate health issues with heat related morbidity and mortality in Africa being projected to increase [26] [27] [53] [54] [55] . Studies have also projected that the geographical distribution of disease prone areas like Malaria will increase as climatic conditions change, creating more conducive conditions for new diseases to breed in areas that were previously disease free [53] [55] [56] [57] . Projected rainfall change patterns indicated significant increase in high rainfall extremes were exhibited in periods leading up to 2050 and 2070. In the case of temperature, the projections from all the models showed increase in minimum and maximum temperatures in all seasons and sub periods, like being observed temperature projection over other parts of the world. Most of livelihoods and the socio-economic activities in Somalia are dependent on water availability from rainfall. The 2030, 2050 and 2070 projected rainfall and temperature change scenarios show that Somalia future development and livelihoods in future will face increased threats of climate extremes unless effective climate smart adaptation systems form integral components of national development strategies. With the prolonging socio economic stability in the country, the development of the required community based effective climate smart adaptation systems will require support from global and regional partners. Efforts to achieve food security in Somalia have long been hampered by climate extremes such as floods and drought, as well as civil wars, political volatility, rapid population growth, among other miseries [4] [23] [58] [59] . Most of the socio-economic activities in Lower Jubba are rain dependent. Recurring drought and floods cause acute stress on a developing economy such as that of Lower Jubba. Flooding in Lower Jubba has been linked to RVF outbreaks which in the past has resulted in a ban in the export of livestock from Somalia and led to massive losses for communities and the Somali economy [60] [61] [62] . Rainfall variability, particularly the projected recurrence of below average extremes in the near future would also impact the rate of restoration of disturbed vegetation. Temperature anomalies indicate recurrences of positive anomalies within all the three projected periods except for OND where some negative anomalies were evident during the first projection period. Seasonal differences, in the observed temperature projections, were quite evident and are major issues that require more studies in order to develop effective and realistic climate change and disaster risk reduction strategies. Long term adaptation planning by the Jubaland Administration for Lower Jubba must take an integrated approach to both floods and drought for both the near, mid and far future. Investment in early warning systems for daily, monthly, seasonal and inter-annual prediction is critical for any effective adaptation strategy. Timely seasonal forecasts and drought monitoring is essential for drought risk reduction in Lower Jubba where livelihoods are closely intertwined with climate variability. The study further provides some important knowledge on rainfall variability and change over the Lower Jubba region that would contribute to the 6th IPCC assessment report on the state of regional climate change over Africa. The knowledge on the past, present and future rainfall patterns derived from this study is important in the development of any effective disaster risk reduction and climate change strategies of Somalia in supporting sustainable development goals, implementation of the Paris UNFCCC, Sendai disaster risk reduction, among other global, regional, national and community based resilience building frameworks.', 'summary': 'Keywords:  Increasing evidence is able to link climate change to major and minor threats to natural systems, threatening environmental, social and economic development [1] [2] . Climate change impacts are projected to slow down economic growth, making poverty reduction even more difficult, while prolonging existing poverty traps [2] . Increase in temperature could also change the ecology of infectious diseases as well as increase temperature related mortality and morbidity of people and livestock [2] [26] [27] . Climate Change projections for Somalia will be used to derive information regarding the potential increase of the threats of climate extremes on future development and livelihoods. Data from the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) Africa framework was used in this study to project scenarios for precipitation in Lower Jubba. At the same time the analysis showed significant biases in individual models depending on sub-region and season; however, the ensemble mean had better agreement with observation than individual models. The analysis concluded that the multi-model ensemble mean simulates eastern Africa rainfall adequately and could therefore be used for the assessment of future climate projections for the region. The CORDEX RCMs data was obtained from IGAD Climate Prediction and Application Centre (ICPAC) which is the WMO regional climate center for the Greater Horn of Africa. The ensemble model data was used in this study to compute the correlation value r and linear trend lines for each pixel for the individual seasons.

In Sub-Saharan Africa, vulnerability to climate change for local communities is increased because of their dependence on rain fed agriculture [3] [4] [5] [6] . Large populations in Somalia in particular have experienced severer impacts due to water stress as their livelihoods are dependent on access to water and pasture [7] [8] . 94% of nomadic populations in Somalia are reportedly living in poverty. Somaliaâ\x80\x99s long coastal line provides fishing livelihood systems threatened by unique marine systems that include Somalia ocean currents systems, tropical cyclones and before tropical cyclones. Somalia has seen an increase in frequency and intensity of floods and droughts with severe droughts in 2007/2008, 2011/2012, 2015/16/17 [9] . Climate induced displacement in Somalia continues to increase with UN listing the number of internally displaced persons due to drought between November 2016 and October 2017 at 943,000 [10] . Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (2015-2030) recognized the difficulty in achieving sustainable development without the development of climate smart systems. Climate change impacts are projected to slow down economic growth, making poverty reduction even more difficult, while prolonging existing poverty traps [2] . Climate change risks undermine the sustainability of basic livelihoods, threatening food security, health among other socio-economic impacts. Without proper adaptation measures, the projected increase in frequency and severity of weather and climate extremes will undermine the safety of ecosystems and health [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . The need to strengthen Somaliaâ\x80\x99s capacity to deal with disasters, such as the protracted droughts and floods that it continues to face, is critical [16] . The study attempted to provide projected rainfall and temperature change scenarios for Lower Jubba region, Somalia. This was done using the downscaled Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) RCMs data. The annual rainfall and temperature cycles simulated by an ensemble of CORDEX RCMs were compared with the observed data. The analysis focused on the Gu long rain season, which had the best agreement in comparison to the observed rainfall data. Projections for temperature were done for all the standard global climatological seasons namely northern hemisphere summer, winter, autumn and spring seasons that correspond to June to August, December to February, September to November, March to May months. The projections of the future Gu long rain season characteristics was done using the IPCC projected periods of 2030, 2050 and 2070 benchmarks. Lower Jubba is located in the Jubaland state of Somalia [17] [18] . Jubaland consists of the Gedo, Lower Jubba and Middle Jubba regions, and lies 40 - 60 km east of the Jubba River, stretching from Gedo to the Indian Ocean. The state of Jubaland borders the Garrisa, Wajir and Mandera County of Kenya on the western side. Kismayo, located in Lower Jubba, is the largest city in Jubaland, and the third largest city in Somalia after Mogadishu and Hargesa [19] . Lower Jubba receives about 350 mm rainfall during Gu (AMJ) season and an average of 250 mm Deyr (SON) season. Lower Jubba saw a general decreasing trend in rainfall during the Gu rainfall season, and a general increasing trend in the Deyr rainfall between 1981 to 2015 [20] . The Lower Jubba region has also experienced an increase in occurrence of depressed rainfall usually associated with drought, and a decrease in the frequency of above normal rainfall associated with floods [20] . Studies on the GHA show a decrease of MAM long rains and increase in the OND short rains [21] [22] [23] . Lower Jubba has seen increasing trends in the minimum, maximum and average temperature [20], consistent with the results from many recent studies worldwide [2] [24] [25] . Increase in temperature could also change the ecology of infectious diseases as well as increase temperature related mortality and morbidity of people and livestock [2] [26] [27] . Climate Change projections for Somalia will be used to derive information regarding the potential increase of the threats of climate extremes on future development and livelihoods. It will also enable the development of effective climate smart adaptation strategies. Details of area of study, data used and methodologies adopted are highlighted in the following sections. Gridded CHIRPS and GeoCLIM observations for the period 1960-90 were used as the baseline observations data. CHIRPS is a global dataset (50Ë\x9aS - 50Ë\x9aN, 180Ë\x9aE - 180Ë\x9aW), 0.05Ë\x9a resolution, 1981 to near-present gridded precipitation time series. CHIRPS data are produced by scientists at the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) Climate Hazard Group (CHG) and the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Earth Resources Observation and Science (EROS) Center. The data was developed to support the United States Agency for International Development Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET). Rainfall Measuring Mission Multi-satellite Precipitation Analysis version 7 (TMPA 3B42 v7) is used to calibrate global Cold Cloud Duration (CCD) rainfall estimates. Details on CHIRPS data and their usability in the region are well documented by ICPAC among many others [28] [29] . A coordinated set of the 20th and 21st century climate simulations for the Atmosphere Ocean coupled Global Climate Models (AOGCMs) in the Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5) have been contributed to by climate modelling groups from all around the world [30] . Data from the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) Africa framework was used in this study to project scenarios for precipitation in Lower Jubba. The CORDEX program is an initiative by World Climate Research Program (WCRP) of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) that generates high-resolution climate projections (50 km) for climate studies, within the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) timeline and beyond [31] [32] [33] . CORDEX data used in this study represented precipitation fairly well over the region and thus can be used to inform on adaptation and mitigation strategies [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] . These climate models describe the coupling of the atmosphere with the land surface, with differing dynamics and physics formulations [31] [37] . For each experiment the historical runs, forced by observed natural and anthropogenic atmospheric composition, cover the period from 1950-2005. The future projections (2006-2100) are forced with two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP), namely; RCP4.5 (mid-range emissions) and RCP8.5 (high-end emissions) scenarios, which prescribe future atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations and aerosols. Detail on the CORDEX RCMs can be found in Endris [32] and Nikulin [33] . Endris [32] evaluated the ability of the CORDEX RCMs in simulating the general characteristics of the climate over Eastern Africa region by analyzing the annual cycle, spatial variability, pattern correlation and root mean square error using a Taylor diagram. The study found that these RCMs reasonably simulate the main features of the rainfall climatology over eastern Africa and also reproduce the majority of the documented regional responses to ENSO and IOD forcings. At the same time the analysis showed significant biases in individual models depending on sub-region and season; however, the ensemble mean had better agreement with observation than individual models. The analysis concluded that the multi-model ensemble mean simulates eastern Africa rainfall adequately and could therefore be used for the assessment of future climate projections for the region. The CORDEX RCMs data was obtained from IGAD Climate Prediction and Application Centre (ICPAC) which is the WMO regional climate center for the Greater Horn of Africa. In this study the region of interest was Lower Jubba that is bounded by latitudes 1.5Ë\x9aS - 12.0Ë\x9aN and longitudes 41.0Ë\x9aE - 51.0Ë\x9aE. There IPCC based climate projection reference period were used namely 2030 (sub-period 1), sub-period up to 2050 (sub-period 2), and sub-period up to 2070 (sub-period 3). The study was divided into two major sections namely assessment of Model Skill in Simulating Observed Climate during the period 1961-1990, and the projection of future rainfall and temperature scenarios. Standard methods were adopted to determine the best climate model/s that could be used for the projection of future climate change scenarios for Lower Jubba region of Somalia for the two standard rainfall seasons Gu (April to June) and Deyr (September to November). The temperature simulations were for all standard seasons of the year in Somalia namely December-February (DJF), March-May (MAM), July-August (JJA), and September-November (SON). Standard methods were also adopted to test the spatial and temporal bias of the individual models. The methods used included various time series methods, correlation and regression analysis. Correlation methods examined correlations between the observed and simulated outputs at specific grid point locations. The square of the correlation coefficient is knows as coefficient of determination (r2) which represented the variance of the observed data that could be accounted for by the predicted variable. Regression method attempted to fit the best linear mathematical equation for the observed relationships. The statistical significance of the fitted linear regression trends were examined using graphical approaches as well as the standards statistical test that include the use of Mann-Kendall Rank Statistics. Similar methods have been adopted in many studies in Africa and the world at large [6] [20] [22] [24] [38] [39] [40] . A linear regression trend was investigated by examining the relationship between time (T) and the variable of interest (X), in this case rainfall, using the following equation X(t) is the individual observed seasonal rainfall/temperature during the baseline period 1960-1990, while Y(t) are corresponding values simulated by the individual CORDEX models over the period 1961-1990, c and b are normally the intercept and gradient (slope) of the regression equation. The slope indicates the average rate of change in the dependent variable in each year of the given time period. A positive/negative slope shows an increasing/decreasing trend respectively. The limitation of this method is that it assumes that all linkages between observed and CORDEX models generated models are linear, and the distributions of the observed and predicted records are normal. For non-normal data the study included nonparametric tests namely the Mann-Kendall rank statistics method was used. In the Mann-Kendall analysis data is ranked after being placed in time sequential order. The time series values (X1, X2, X3, X4 â\x80¦, Xn) where X in this case represents rainfall are replaced by their relative ranks (R1, R2, R3, R4 â\x80¦, Rn) (starting from the lowest value up to n). The relative magnitudes of sample data is compared rather than the data values themselves [41] [42] [43] . The equation used is as follows, where S is the Kendall score given a dataset R with a sample size of n values. The Kendall statistics s is given in Equation (2) below based on Kendall, 1938; 1945; 1948 The observed trend is significant if s values in Equation (2) have significance levels equal or less than 0.5. The ensemble model data was used in this study to compute the correlation value r and linear trend lines for each pixel for the individual seasons. The results for both correlation coefficient r value and the slope were mapped for each pixel and season. The results from the assessment of Model Skill in Simulating Observed Climate for the various seasons determined the models and seasons that were projected into the future using CORDEX RCA4.5 models. The three sub-periods used in the projections included the sub-periods up to 2030 (sub-period 1), up to 2050 (sub-period 2), and up to 2070 (sub-period 3). The results from model verification and climate change projections with CORDEX RCA4.5 models are independently highlighted in the following sections. The annual cycle of Gu (AMJ) and Deyr (SON) season rainfall for the baseline period 1960-90 from gridded CHIRPS observations and CORDEX RCMs simulated outputs were compared the study area in order to determine the best ensemble models that can be used for the future climate change rainfall projections. Future projections of temperature were undertaken for all the four standard seasons of the year. Figure 1(a) and Figure 1(b) illustrate the performance of CORDEX RCMs in simulating annual rainfall and temperature cycles over the study area as compared to the CHIRPS data. All of the RCMs capture fairly well the rainfall seasonality in Lower Jubba. Figure 1(a) shows that the north-south rainfall pattern follows the migration of the ITCZ, with associated locations of maximum rainfall being depicted fairly well by the ensemble model. For the study area, the ensemble mean results were found to simulate fairly well the annual rainfall cycle when compared to individual RCM models. In general, the study revealed some fairly good agreement between annual rainfall cycle simulated by ensemble of CORDEX RCMs and the CHIRPS data. The most notable shortcoming in most individual RCMs is the early peak and overestimation of the mean monthly rainfall particularly in the Deyr season (Figure 1(a)). Studies have shown that GCMs tend to overestimate rainfall in the Horn of Africa region during October to December season [2] [44] . IPCC reports have indicated limitation in the extent of skilful rainfall projection due to the nonlinear and chaotic nature of the climate system [2] . Results from the study showed that the ensemble models closely reproduced realistic representation of the observed climate features. Figure 1(b) shows the performance of CORDEX RCMs in simulating the mean surface temperature over Jubaland compared to the observed temperature data. The ensemble model seems to overestimate temperature when compared to the observed data during the hot months of Jan-April while underestimate during July to December, Figure 1(b). The results from the study indicated that the multi-model ensembles outperformed the individual RCM model as shown in Figure 2(a) and Figure 2(b). All of the RCMs however captured fairly well the rainfall seasonality in Lower Jubba, though significant biases can be found in individual models depending on the seasons as seen in Figure 2(a). The model bias for precipitation in each individual model varies from month to month. NOAA, CNRM and MPI and overestimated the rainfall data between August and November while MIROC underestimates the rainfall data in the same period. Figure 2(b) also showed variation in performance of the RCMs from month to month even with the temperature data. ICHEC underestimated the temperatures between January and June, while NOAA underestimated the data between July and December. MOCH and NCC overestimated the data in April. Similar results are from some previous studies for the Multi-model ensemble projections [2] [34] [35] [36] . It observed from the examination of the skill of the individual CORDEX models and ensemble models simulation observed CHIRPS and GEOCLIM data over the period 1961-1990 best during Gu (AMJ) season. Thus projection of future rainfall scenarios was undertaken for only the Gu (AMJ) season. The projections undertaken for temperature were observed for all seasons. It observed from the examination of the skill of the individual CORDEX models and ensemble models simulation observed CHIRPS and GEOCLIM data over the period 1961-1990 best during Gu (AMJ) season. Thus projection of future rainfall scenarios was undertaken for only the Gu (AMJ) season. The projections undertaken for temperature were observed for all seasons. The results for future projections of rainfall and temperature with the CORDEX RCMs are given below for IPCC sub periods of 2030, 2050 and 2070. The simulations of rainfall concentrated on the Gu (April-June) season, where most models showed more realistic simulations of rainfall. The geographical distribution exhibits notable spatial variability in rainfall over Lower Jubba. Badhaadhe district towards the southern coast exhibits the highest amount of rainfall as seen in Table 1. The southern costal region shows the highest projected amount of rainfall in Lower Jubba throughout all three sub-periods as was seen with the historical data published [20] . The patterns of the projected changes in seasonal ensemble mean Gu rainfall for the three sub-periods namely 2030, 2050 and 2070 showed significant variations in the magnitude of the projected seasonal rainfall from place to place, season, sub-periods and scenarios. There is a general increase in rainfall in Lower Jubba from 2030 to 2070. The projected rainfall is however not homogeneous throughout the region with the inland region receiving the least amount of rainfall. Similar results are reported in the Somali NAPA which shows an increase in rainfall in 2050 and 2080 [45] . This is also supported by IPCC studies that project an increase in MAM rainfall in 2050-2100 in most parts of Eastern Africa [2] . North eastern Kenya bordering Lower Jubba is projected to receive an increase in rainfall of 40% relative to the baseline period (1981-2010) by 2100 during its long rain season [46] . Table 1 shows the range of seasonal precipitation from the projected ensemble data for Gu, averaged over the districts in Jubaland, with RCP4.5 scenario for the three sub-periods 2030, 2050 and 2070. The observed trends of the temporal evolution of the projected precipitation over this region are shown in Figures 3(a)-(c). The results show a decreasing trend for the first sub-period Figure 3(a), followed by an increasing trend for the second and third sub-periods Figure 3(b) and Figure 3(c). The trends are however not statistically significant at a 95% confidence level. Despite being statistically insignificant the results are similar to those of studies over the region [1] [2] [47] . For Africa, IPCC projects that almost all countries except South Africa will probably experience a significant reduction in precipitation until 2050 which then increases significantly between 2050 and 2100 [2] corroborating the results displayed in Figures 3(a)-(c). The averaged mean water vapor, evaporation and precipitation are projected to increase globally by 2100 [1] [2] . The use of climate change knowledge, particularly when mainstreamed into planned policies and poverty reduction strategies can provide a starting point for the identification of climate risks at a district, regional and national level. The projected rainfall further shows dominant dry and wet phases of the Gu season in the future (Figure 4), which calls for sustained investment in early warning mechanisms, and water management systems. The spatial representation of the projected rainfall trends showed no homogenous patterns throughout the three study sub periods. While some areas in Lower Jubba are projected to have general decrease in rainfall during the long rain season, other areas were projected to have a general increase in rainfall (Table 2). General increasing trend was however seen throughout Lower Jubba, with different magnitude of the changes. Details of the pattern in the trend in each district can be seen in Table 2. Although the projected rainfall trends were still not statistically significant, the complexity of the observed characteristics of the changes continues to call for further studies and tailored mitigation and adaptation strategies over the region of study. Individual rainfall time series shown in Figure 5 further indicate general dominance of depressed rainfall during the sub period ending in 2030, followed with dominance of positive rainfall anomalies during the last two sub-periods ending in 2050 and 2070. These results signify the need for investment in early warning mechanisms in Lower Jubba. Results on Lower Jubba are similar to projected results for Africa, where the impacts of climate change will be exacerbated by widespread poverty, diseases and high population growth rates, which would intensify the demand for food, water and livestock [47] [48] . The projected recurrence of depressed rainfall for the near future is significant for a country that is already highly vulnerable with high poverty levels across multiple dimensions [49] . Somalia is already experiencing food insecurity, the implication of a further risk to food and water security could pause a threat on security in a struggle for available resources. Furthermore, results from this study have shown that communities in Lower Jubba revert to charcoal production when their livelihoods are threatened, the impact of which is forest degradation. The recurrence of extreme below normal rainfall often associated with drought is also evident, given the communities use of charcoal as an adaptation strategy, an increase in deforestation and degradation can be expected. The projected precipitation presented in this study call for urgency in finding short and mid-term solutions. The increase in above average rainfall associated with floods as seen in Figure 4 by in sub-period 2 (2050) is also consistent with Tierney, et al. and IPCC that projects increased precipitation in Africa generally during the same period [1] [2] [47] . The magnitude of the extreme above and below average rainfall for the projected future is not the same as seen in Figure 4. Similar results in the bordering regions in Kenya, project an increase in intensity of rainfall, and extreme rainfall events [46] . The spatial pattern of the projected seasonal ensemble mean surface temperature based on the RCMs are shown for the three sub-periods namely 2030, 2050 and 2070 relative to the baseline period showed general warming at most locations over the three sub periods ending in 2030, 2050 and 2070. Results however show that projected change in temperature will vary from season to season and district to district. Like the observed GISTEMP data [20], the average temperature seems to increase towards the southern costal band in all seasons, possibly due to influence by Indian Ocean [50] . The ensemble models however seemed to overestimate the temperature in JJA which according to the observed data [20] should register the lowest temperature. Results from the temperature time series (Figure 6) show an increasing temperatures in both the near to long term future. This is in line with global and regional reports that project an increase in the average temperature by 2030 and a further increase by 2050 [2] [24] [25] [44] [51] . Results are statistically significant at 95% confidence level. Changes in temperature and humidity are reportedly linked to increased vector borne diseases and helminthes infections [52] . This will also have far reaching implications on many socio-economic sectors. Figure 5 shows the anomalies in the projected temperature time series. Results are similar to IPCC [2] reports projecting more hot and fewer cold temperature extremes in most places as global mean temperatures increase in a seasonal time scale. Results showed the rate of increase in temperature by 0.3 to 0.7 degrees by 2035. The unique patterns of the temperature time series is the tendencies for the annual temperature extremes to be generally higher that the preceding years. WMO recent observations have shown such tendencies in the recent years for the annual mean temperature time series. In general, the projections for Lower Jubba indicated an increase in minimum and maximum temperatures in all seasons in the projection periods 2030, 2050 and 2070. Temperature projections are critical in the development of effective and realistic climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction strategies. The impact of an increasing temperature would be far reaching for most socio-economic sectors including community safety, water, food, energy, infrastructure, among others [26] [53] [54] . The projected temperature would also exacerbate health issues with heat related morbidity and mortality in Africa being projected to increase [26] [27] [53] [54] [55] . Studies have also projected that the geographical distribution of disease prone areas like Malaria will increase as climatic conditions change, creating more conducive conditions for new diseases to breed in areas that were previously disease free [53] [55] [56] [57] . Projected rainfall change patterns indicated significant increase in high rainfall extremes were exhibited in periods leading up to 2050 and 2070. In the case of temperature, the projections from all the models showed increase in minimum and maximum temperatures in all seasons and sub periods, like being observed temperature projection over other parts of the world. Most of livelihoods and the socio-economic activities in Somalia are dependent on water availability from rainfall. The 2030, 2050 and 2070 projected rainfall and temperature change scenarios show that Somalia future development and livelihoods in future will face increased threats of climate extremes unless effective climate smart adaptation systems form integral components of national development strategies. With the prolonging socio economic stability in the country, the development of the required community based effective climate smart adaptation systems will require support from global and regional partners. Efforts to achieve food security in Somalia have long been hampered by climate extremes such as floods and drought, as well as civil wars, political volatility, rapid population growth, among other miseries [4] [23] [58] [59] . Most of the socio-economic activities in Lower Jubba are rain dependent. Recurring drought and floods cause acute stress on a developing economy such as that of Lower Jubba. Flooding in Lower Jubba has been linked to RVF outbreaks which in the past has resulted in a ban in the export of livestock from Somalia and led to massive losses for communities and the Somali economy [60] [61] [62] . Rainfall variability, particularly the projected recurrence of below average extremes in the near future would also impact the rate of restoration of disturbed vegetation. Temperature anomalies indicate recurrences of positive anomalies within all the three projected periods except for OND where some negative anomalies were evident during the first projection period. Seasonal differences, in the observed temperature projections, were quite evident and are major issues that require more studies in order to develop effective and realistic climate change and disaster risk reduction strategies. Long term adaptation planning by the Jubaland Administration for Lower Jubba must take an integrated approach to both floods and drought for both the near, mid and far future. Investment in early warning systems for daily, monthly, seasonal and inter-annual prediction is critical for any effective adaptation strategy. Timely seasonal forecasts and drought monitoring is essential for drought risk reduction in Lower Jubba where livelihoods are closely intertwined with climate variability. The study further provides some important knowledge on rainfall variability and change over the Lower Jubba region that would contribute to the 6th IPCC assessment report on the state of regional climate change over Africa. The knowledge on the past, present and future rainfall patterns derived from this study is important in the development of any effective disaster risk reduction and climate change strategies of Somalia in supporting sustainable development goals, implementation of the Paris UNFCCC, Sendai disaster risk reduction, among other global, regional, national and community based resilience building frameworks.', 'summary': 'Keywords:  Increasing evidence is able to link climate change to major and minor threats to natural systems, threatening environmental, social and economic development [1] [2] . Climate change impacts are projected to slow down economic growth, making poverty reduction even more difficult, while prolonging existing poverty traps [2] . Increase in temperature could also change the ecology of infectious diseases as well as increase temperature related mortality and morbidity of people and livestock [2] [26] [27] . Climate Change projections for Somalia will be used to derive information regarding the potential increase of the threats of climate extremes on future development and livelihoods. Data from the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) Africa framework was used in this study to project scenarios for precipitation in Lower Jubba. At the same time the analysis showed significant biases in individual models depending on sub-region and season; however, the ensemble mean had better agreement with observation than individual models. The analysis concluded that the multi-model ensemble mean simulates eastern Africa rainfall adequately and could therefore be used for the assessment of future climate projections for the region. The CORDEX RCMs data was obtained from IGAD Climate Prediction and Application Centre (ICPAC) which is the WMO regional climate center for the Greater Horn of Africa. The ensemble model data was used in this study to compute the correlation value r and linear trend lines for each pixel for the individual seasons. The results from model verification and climate change projections with CORDEX RCA4.5 models are independently highlighted in the following sections. Results from the study showed that the ensemble models closely reproduced realistic representation of the observed climate features. Temperature projections are critical in the development of effective and realistic climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction strategies. With the prolonging socio economic stability in the country, the development of the required community based effective climate smart adaptation systems will require support from global and regional partners.'}, {'authors': {'Manyu Chang': 'articles.aspx?searchCode=Manyu+Chang&searchField=authors&page=1&SKID=0', 'Claudine Dereczynski': 'articles.aspx?searchCode=Claudine+Dereczynski&searchField=authors&page=1&SKID=0', 'Marcos A.

Positive tendencies in the frequency of occurrence and duration of heat waves, as well as in the amount of rain associated with extreme events are observed in more areas than negative trends. Unfortunately such results are of medium confidence due to insufficient data and studies in the region. For North America, Central America, Europe and Mediterranean results are more conclusive and show with high confidence the unequivocal warming. According to the IPCC, the air temperature at the surface (ocean and continent) measured globally increased by 0.85Ë\x9aC over the period 1880-2012. In this paper, some of the indicators of climatic extremes presented by the IPCC are used to compose the proposed Climate Change Index (CCI) whose objective is to indicate the degree of future susceptibility to cli- matic extremes in a given region. The CCI, along with other indices of biophysical susceptibility and socioeconomic vulnerability is used to comprise the synthesized Vulnerability Index (VI) for climatic extremes [2] . The VI seeks to identify vulnerabilities to climatic extremes of different dimensions that make certain regions sus- ceptible to the impacts of climate change, with possible future exacerbations beyond what is happening at present. The methodology used to construct the CCI reflects in a great extend the methodology used in the report â\x80\x9cMap of the Vulnerability of the People of the State of Rio de Janeiro to the Impacts of Climate Change upon Social, Health and Environmental Areasâ\x80\x9d authored by FIOCRUZ and SEA-RJ 2011 [3] . In this report mean values of air temperature and precipitation are used. The present research opted for five indicators of climatic extremes as opposed to averages, since studies have shown an amplification of extremes in recent decades, despite the fact that climatological mean values have suffered little change [4] . Moreover, changes in extremes, as pointed out by the [1] , have a much bigger impact on society and ecosystems in general than the increase in average values [5] -[7] . The proposed methodology is applied to the state of Paraná, which was initiated by the study on the detection of climate change, considering indicators of climatic extremes from observational data from the Agronomic In- stitute of Paraná [8] . The methodology and data used to calculate the CCI are given in Section 2; the results of applying the methodology to the state of Paraná are presented in Section 3; and the conclusions in Section 4. The meteorological data for the calculation of indicators of climatic extremes used to construct the CCI are ob- tained from simulations from the Eta regional model with horizontal resolution of 40 km by 40 km. The regional Eta model [9] was nested inside the HadCM3 global coupled model [10] . This downscaling of global model si- mulations of the HadCM3 Eta model for South America will be called Eta-HadCM3. For present climate condi- tions (1961-1990) the CO2 concentration was considered to be 330 ppm, and for the future (2041-2070) climate, the emission scenario from the A1B Special Report on Emission Scenarios was used-SRES [11] . Four integra- tions were made with the Eta-HadCM3, generated from perturbations of the physics of the HadCM3 model. Among these four runs two were used in this study, one member (or scenario) which showed the highest climate sensitivity at the end of the century, to be referred to here as â\x80\x9chighâ\x80\x9d, and another member which had the lowest climate sensitivity, to be called â\x80\x9clowâ\x80\x9d. The climate sensitivity is based on the change in global temperature. The use of these two runs was an attempt to span the possible variations that the HadCM3 model produced in its global simulations. According to [12] , although the four runs all correspond to the A1B emission scenario, the projections of temperature increase resulting from each of the runs show similarities to increases characteristic of scenarios of low (B1) and high emission (A2 or A1FI). Reference [13] evaluated the simulations of the Eta-HadCM3 model for South America and showed good agreement between the simulations of the present climate and the observational data, suggesting adequacy of the model for studies of climate change in South America. Reference [12] evaluated the climate projections of the Eta-HadCM3 model for South America for the future climate. The projections indicate a strong warming (between 4Ë\x9aC and 6Ë\x9aC) on the South American continent and strong reductions of rainfall in Amazonia and Northeast Brazil (reaching up to 40% compared to the present). All model projections point to more intense changes after 2041, indicating a drier and warmer climate in the ba- sins of the Amazon, São Francisco and Paraná rivers, with small changes in precipitation for the last of these. The variables used for the calculation of indicators of climatic extremesâ\x80\x94air temperature every 6 hours and daily precipitationâ\x80\x94are extracted from each of the 216 gridpoints of the Eta-HadCM3 model simulations over Paraná, with each point covering 40 × 40 km2 of the territory of this state, as shown in Figure 1. For each model grid point, the indicators of climatic extremes are calculated for air temperature and precipita- tion from the present climate (1961-1990) and the future climate (2041-2070), for the â\x80\x9chighâ\x80\x9d and â\x80\x9clowâ\x80\x9d mem- bers. The choice of a future period at an intermediate distance between 2011 and 2099 is due to the fact that, a future that is too distant, such as 2100, makes things more difficult for political decision-makers trying to grasp such a time span. In the present research, five indicators of climatic extremes were selected from among those developed by the Expert Team on Climate Change Detection Monitoring and Indices (ETCCDMI), established by the Commis- sion for Climatology of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and by the CLIVAR Climate Variabil- ity and Predictability Program to make viable a global analysis of climate extremes. The five indicators of climatic extremes used in this research are: annual rainfall totals for rainy days, i.e., days when rainfall is greater than or equal to 1 mm (PRCPTOT, in mm); total annual rainfall on days when rain- fall is greater than that of the 95th percentile of the rainy days (R95p, in mm); maximum number of consecutive dry days for the year, that is, the days on which rainfall is less than 1 mm (CDD, in days) and annual mean maxi- mum (TMAXmean) and minimum (TMINmean) temperatures, in degrees Celsius. These indicators are gener- ated with the aid of the RClimdex program [14] , formulated in Canada and designed specifically to calculate climatic extremes. The term â\x80\x9cclimatic anomalyâ\x80\x9d as used in this study is the absolute difference of the changes projected by the model for the future climate relative to its current climate. The outputs of the program RClimdex provide an annual value for each of the five indicators analyzed. Initially obtained for each grid point are the average values of the present (1961-1990) and future (2041-2070) period for PRCPTOT, R95p, CDD, TMAXmean and TMIN mean. Next we compute the â\x80\x9canomaliesâ\x80\x9d as shown in Equation (1), obtaining the value of APRCPTOT, AR95p, ACDD, and ATMAXmean and ATMINmean at each grid point in the model. where AEXT represents the anomaly of the indicator of a climatic extreme and the bar represents the mean val- ue of EXT in the period considered. In addition to calculating climatic anomalies as described in Equation (1), we proceeded to normalize them, i.e., the â\x80\x9cclimatic anomaliesâ\x80\x9d were also divided by their respective standard deviations (Equation (2)) calculated from the present climate. The â\x80\x9cnormalized climatic anomalyâ\x80\x9d (Equation (3)) reflects more effectively the impact of future climate change in relation to the present climate. In other words, the degree of stress due to a future climate change depends on the variability experienced in the present climate. This interpretation of â\x80\x9cstandard climatic anomalyâ\x80\x9d leads to the inference that the greater the present variability (standard deviation), the less the effect of stress felt due to future variation, because it is expected that populations and ecosystems would al- ready be accustomed to the variability in a given phenomenon, and therefore are already adapted to it. where is the total number of years, EXT are the values of the indicators of climatic extremes (PRCPTOT, R95p, CDD, TMAXmean and TMINmean) for each year, DPEXT is the standard deviation of the indicator of climatic extreme and is the normalized anomaly of the indicator of the climatic extreme. Despite the advantages of standardization as described above, the analyses related purely to â\x80\x9cclimatic anoma- liesâ\x80\x9d (without normalization) are maintained here in order to stress the absolute magnitude of the changes pro- jected for the future (2041-2070) in relation to the present (1961-1990) for air temperature and precipitation. After the calculation of the â\x80\x9cnormalized climatic anomaliesâ\x80\x9d for each indicator of an extreme at each grid point in the state of Paraná, these are divided into classes. The division into classes considers the lowest and highest value of the â\x80\x9cnormalized anomaliesâ\x80\x9d of the five indicators of extremes obtained at all model grid points for each of the two members, â\x80\x9chighâ\x80\x9d and â\x80\x9clowâ\x80\x9d. For each of the classes a score is assigned ranging from 0 to 1, with a score of 0 attributed to the smallest and 1 to the largest with respect to the standard deviation. In order to obtain the indicators of normalized climatic extremes for each of the 399 municipalities in the state of Paraná, the Grid Analyst ArcGIS 10.1 program was used, with the aid of the Extract Value Grid with Polygon command. The polygon in this case is the geographic representation of each municipality that is superimposed on the contours resulting from the interpolation of the grid data. This process of â\x80\x9cmunicipalizationâ\x80\x9d generates for each municipality in Paraná a normalized anomaly indicator for each of the five chosen parameters. The Climate Change Index (CCI) is represented by the highest score of the class of anomalies among the five indicators of climate extremes for the â\x80\x9chighâ\x80\x9d and â\x80\x9clowâ\x80\x9d members, as shown in Equation (4). This is achieved with the understanding that when one of the variables under analysis presents a significant climatic anomaly, be it temperature, precipitation or drought stress, this is sufficient to characterize the susceptibility to future climate change, so that the calculation of the average anomalies cannot mischaracterize the intensity of anomalies and underestimate important critical aspects. In this section the methodology proposed for the calculation of the CCI is presented for the state of Paraná. The results and maps obtained give indications of the anomalies of the climatic extremes in the state for the â\x80\x9chighâ\x80\x9d member, projected for the period 2041-2070. Initially, the distribution of the anomalies of the climatic extremes associated with precipitation and air temperature is analyzed. In Figures 2-4, the anomaly strips are shown for the indicators of climatic extremes of precipitation, which in- cludes APRCPTOT, AR95P and ACDD, for the â\x80\x9chighâ\x80\x9d member. It is noted on the maps of APRCPTOT and R95p a similar pattern of anomaly, with increased rainfall in almost the entire region studied, intensifying from north to south in the state. The total annual rainfall on wet days (PRCPTOT) projected from 2041 to 2070 (rela- tive to 1961-1990) shows an average increase ranging from 15 mm in the north to 466 mm in the south, includ- ing the coast. In regard to ACDD higher values can be seen, indicating dry periods that are longer in the north- east but fall off towards the southwest coast of the state. In the northeast of the state it is projected for 2041- 2070 an average increase of about 7 days in the duration of periods of consecutive dry days. For the extremes of temperature (ATMAXmean and ATMINmean), a projection of warming throughout the state is noted, with the largest increases of temperature in the northeast, approximately 4Ë\x9aC in the â\x80\x9chighâ\x80\x9d mem ber, decreasing in the direction of the coast. This indicates that the present-day rate of increase of TMAXmean and TMINmean, which is statistically significant at +0.02Ë\x9aC/year [8] , will be intensified in the future. In order to facilitate the interpretation of the CCI, the predominant anomalies were grouped into three categories: 1) precipitation anomaly, grouping the anomalies of APRCPTOT and AR95p; 2) anomaly of hydrologicstress, which is the same as the anomaly ACDD; and 3) temperature anomaly, composed of the maximum (ATMAX- mean) and minimum (ATMINmean) temperature anomalies. Table 1 shows the average for each indicator of extreme climate throughout the state of Paraná from its nor- malized anomalies. We note that with the normalization of extreme weather anomalies projected for 2041-2070, the prevailing anomaly happens to be, for the most part, related to extremes of temperature, with the minimum temperature () having the greatest influence. The temperature anomaly (and) in the municipalities was significantly larger than all the weather extremes analyzed. For the â\x80\x9chighâ\x80\x9d scenario the projected ATMINmean is 6.79 times larger than its standard deviation in the present climate, while all the mean precipitation anomalies, whether in the â\x80\x9chighâ\x80\x9d or â\x80\x9clowâ\x80\x9d scenario, had values below 1, indicating impacts of little relevance. In other words, the expected future precipitation variability is current already. The distribution of the number of municipalities in Paraná in each score class is shown in Table 2, where it can be seen that even in the â\x80\x9clowâ\x80\x9d scenario the scores are greater than 0.4 and in the â\x80\x9chighâ\x80\x9d scenario 98% of the scores are concentrated between 0.8 and 1. The maps of the normalized anomalies of climatic extremes in the â\x80\x9chighâ\x80\x9d member are shown in Figure 5, ex- cept for and which were omitted because of no indications of large variations in their spatial patterns. values (figure not shown) are very high in almost the entire state, with scores in the class 0.8 - 1.0, except only around the municipality of Telêmaco Borba in the Serra do Cadeado, where the class is slightly lower, between 0.6 and 0.8. Regarding (Figure 6), most of the municipalities show strong anomalies (scoring at 0.6 to 0.8), with a group of 16 municipalities in the far Central-South region showing very strong anomalies (score at 0.8 to 1). With regard to the three indicators analyzed that characterize extremes precipitation, , and, all are low or moderately low in most part of the state. shows a group of municipalities with moderately low index, between 0.2 and 0.4, located in the Southeastern region and some municipalities in the far Southwest of the state (see Figure 7). AR95p showed low intensity (score 0 to 0.2). As for this also showed a group of municipalities with moderately low index in the class from 0.2 to 0.4, also located in the Eastern region of the state, excluding the municipalities at the coast at the Serra do Mar (Fig- ure 8). Superposing the maps of (Figure 8) and (Figure 7) it can be observed that there is a subgroup of 47 municipalities in the south/southeast that is prominent in changing the distribution of preci- pitation, showing an increase in PRCPTOT as well as in CDD, albeit with moderately low intensity (Figure 9). In other words, these municipalities will experience a major shift in the distribution of rainfall, with greatest to- tal annual rainfall and longer dry periods in the future (Figure 9). The municipalities have values of APRCPTOT between 0.4 and 0.6 and ACDD between 0.2 and 0.4. Table 3 groups the municipalities by class of scores of standardized climatic extremes. It appears that in general, the effects of anomalies related to rain (, , and) are of little importance in most municipalities, concentrated as they are in the lowest class of scores (i.e., 0 to 0.2) of low intensity. This is due to the fact that the projected magnitude of the anomaly of precipitation extremes fits within the respective standard deviation of the precipitation extreme of the present climate. Table 3 shows that the greatest susceptibility to future climate change will most likely fall on the minimum temperature, with 394 municipalities (99%) having a very intense anomaly (in the â\x80\x9chighâ\x80\x9d member) with maximum score between 0.8 and 1, corresponding to an increase in the minimum temperature of 6 to 8 times the present-day standard deviation of minimum temperature. The second largest anomaly is very likely to be the maximum temperature (also in the high member) where 16 municipalities have a very intense anomaly, with maximum score from 0.8 to 1 and 374 municipalities (94%) characterized as intense, with a relatively high score, between 0.6 and 0.8, which corresponds to a maximum temperature increase of 5 to 6 times the standard deviation of maximum temperature experienced at present. It should be emphasized that it was established in the methodology of the CCI that if the municipality exhibits only one of the indicators of elevated climatic anomaly, this is sufficient to characterize it as susceptible to a fu- ture climatic anomaly. Consequently, it is concluded that virtually all municipalities in the state will be suscepti- ble to climate change due to their susceptibility to anomalies of maximum and minimum temperatures prevailing in the case of high sensitivity to emissions of greenhouse gases from the A1B scenario. The Climatic Change Index (CCI) is calculated for each municipality, where the analysis of the five climate ex- treme indicators jointly makes apparent the profile of the intensity of the projected anomalies. Figure 10 below is an example of a â\x80\x9cradarâ\x80\x9d chart analysis for the municipality of União da Vitória as an illustration of this kind of visualization. The municipality of União da Vitória is situated in the Central South of the State and, as already mentioned, is part of the group of municipalities with high (moderately low, score = 0.26, while at the same time there is an increase in ACDD, also moderately low in the â\x80\x9chighâ\x80\x9d scenario (â\x80\x9chighâ\x80\x9d, score = 0.21). However, what stands out most for the municipality is the high intensity of the impact of the temperature ano- maly in the â\x80\x9chighâ\x80\x9d member. União da Vitória is one of the municipalities of the group most impacted in the high member with CCI â\x80\x9chighâ\x80\x9d above 0.85 and CCI â\x80\x9clowâ\x80\x9d equal to 0.63. In the â\x80\x9chighâ\x80\x9d member, the impact appears very intense for both the minimum temperature (â\x80\x9chighâ\x80\x9d, score = 0.85) and for the maximum tempera- ture (â\x80\x9chighâ\x80\x9d, score = 0.81). The score â\x80\x9chighâ\x80\x9d of 0.85 represents an anomaly of about six times the standard deviation of the present-day minimum temperature. In this paper we propose the use of a Climate Change Index (CCI) to assess the degree of susceptibility of a re- gion to future climate extremes associated with the air temperature and precipitation. The advantage of this in- dex is the possibility of synthesizing various extreme climatic indicators into a single index in a standardized way. The methodology used to calculate the CCI is based on projections of indicators of climate extremes for a fu- ture period of two climatic scenarios (low and high emission) normalized in relation to their values in the pre- sent climate. The indicators of climatic extremes used are: total annual precipitation for days with rain, i.e., days when rainfall is equal to or greater than 1 mm (PRCPTOT, in mm); total annual rainfall on the days when rainfall is greater than the 95th percentile of the rainy days (R95p, in mm); maximum number of consecutive dry days in the year, or days in which precipitation is less than 1 mm (CDD, in days); and annual averages of maximum (TMAXmean) and minimum (TMINmean) temperatures, in degrees Celsius. The methodology was applied to the state of Paraná from regionalized Eta-HadCM3 projections for the present (1961-1990) and future (2041-2070). The results show an alleged increase in PRCPTOT for the period 2041-2070 as compared to the period 1961-1990, referred as the present climate by the RCM, that is projected to range from 25 mm in the northern part of the state to 465 mm in the south. Likewise, R95p will also increase in the future, following the same spa- tial pattern as PRCPTOT. On the other hand, an increase in CDD is projected, which means longer dry periods. This shows that if the projections prove accurate, then in the decades of 2041-2070 rainfall will be poorly dis- tributed, with stronger and/or more frequent intense rainfall events and longer dry periods. Analysis of the CCI makes clear that differences of projected extreme rainfall (total rainfall, heavy rain and water stress) are insignificant in view of the differences of projected extreme temperatures, since the change in future precipitation falls within the range of present variability. Conversely, the differences of projected extreme temperatures (both minimum and maximum) are likely to range between 2 to 7 times greater than the present variations. In terms of comparison between the two members, the indicators of climatic extremes in the â\x80\x9chighâ\x80\x9d member are in general stronger than those in the â\x80\x9clowâ\x80\x9d member, with a larger number of municipalities with increased vulnerability in the â\x80\x9chighâ\x80\x9d member, in the A1B emission scenario. In terms of location of climate vulnerability within the state, practically all of the state in the â\x80\x9chighâ\x80\x9d member, is found to be in the class with the highest score (CCI > 0.8), which means very intense susceptibility, due to the increase projected in minimum temperatures. These inferences, although preliminary, give indications of the need for preventive actions necessary over the medium and long term, by municipal and state authorities, such as the adaptation of crops, infrastructure, build- ings, and changing of practices and behaviors to cope with projected climatic anomalies. Large strides are being made in the improvement of global and regional models, with increasing accurate re- sults for mapping climate sensitivity and vulnerability. Likewise, in methodological terms, the indicators of climatic extremes selected for the calculation of the CCI can be adjusted to better represent future climate sensitivities to be faced in different states.', 'summary': 'The term â\x80\x9cclimatic anomalyâ\x80\x9d as used in this study is the absolute difference of the changes projected by the model for the future climate relative to its current climate. The â\x80\x9cnormalized climatic anomalyâ\x80\x9d (Equation (3)) reflects more effectively the impact of future climate change in relation to the present climate. In other words, the degree of stress due to a future climate change depends on the variability experienced in the present climate. The results and maps obtained give indications of the anomalies of the climatic extremes in the state for the â\x80\x9chighâ\x80\x9d member, projected for the period 2041-2070. Initially, the distribution of the anomalies of the climatic extremes associated with precipitation and air temperature is analyzed. In Figures 2-4, the anomaly strips are shown for the indicators of climatic extremes of precipitation, which in- cludes APRCPTOT, AR95P and ACDD, for the â\x80\x9chighâ\x80\x9d member. The temperature anomaly (and) in the municipalities was significantly larger than all the weather extremes analyzed. With regard to the three indicators analyzed that characterize extremes precipitation, , and, all are low or moderately low in most part of the state. In the â\x80\x9chighâ\x80\x9d member, the impact appears very intense for both the minimum temperature (â\x80\x9chighâ\x80\x9d, score = 0.85) and for the maximum tempera- ture (â\x80\x9chighâ\x80\x9d, score = 0.81). Conversely, the differences of projected extreme temperatures (both minimum and maximum) are likely to range between 2 to 7 times greater than the present variations.'}]-

In Sub-Saharan Africa, vulnerability to climate change for local communities is increased because of their dependence on rain fed agriculture [3] [4] [5] [6] . Large populations in Somalia in particular have experienced severer impacts due to water stress as their livelihoods are dependent on access to water and pasture [7] [8] . 94% of nomadic populations in Somalia are reportedly living in poverty. Somaliaâ\x80\x99s long coastal line provides fishing livelihood systems threatened by unique marine systems that include Somalia ocean currents systems, tropical cyclones and before tropical cyclones. Somalia has seen an increase in frequency and intensity of floods and droughts with severe droughts in 2007/2008, 2011/2012, 2015/16/17 [9] . Climate induced displacement in Somalia continues to increase with UN listing the number of internally displaced persons due to drought between November 2016 and October 2017 at 943,000 [10] . Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (2015-2030) recognized the difficulty in achieving sustainable development without the development of climate smart systems. Climate change impacts are projected to slow down economic growth, making poverty reduction even more difficult, while prolonging existing poverty traps [2] . Climate change risks undermine the sustainability of basic livelihoods, threatening food security, health among other socio-economic impacts. Without proper adaptation measures, the projected increase in frequency and severity of weather and climate extremes will undermine the safety of ecosystems and health [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . The need to strengthen Somaliaâ\x80\x99s capacity to deal with disasters, such as the protracted droughts and floods that it continues to face, is critical [16] . The study attempted to provide projected rainfall and temperature change scenarios for Lower Jubba region, Somalia. This was done using the downscaled Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) RCMs data. The annual rainfall and temperature cycles simulated by an ensemble of CORDEX RCMs were compared with the observed data. The analysis focused on the Gu long rain season, which had the best agreement in comparison to the observed rainfall data. Projections for temperature were done for all the standard global climatological seasons namely northern hemisphere summer, winter, autumn and spring seasons that correspond to June to August, December to February, September to November, March to May months. The projections of the future Gu long rain season characteristics was done using the IPCC projected periods of 2030, 2050 and 2070 benchmarks. Lower Jubba is located in the Jubaland state of Somalia [17] [18] . Jubaland consists of the Gedo, Lower Jubba and Middle Jubba regions, and lies 40 - 60 km east of the Jubba River, stretching from Gedo to the Indian Ocean. The state of Jubaland borders the Garrisa, Wajir and Mandera County of Kenya on the western side. Kismayo, located in Lower Jubba, is the largest city in Jubaland, and the third largest city in Somalia after Mogadishu and Hargesa [19] . Lower Jubba receives about 350 mm rainfall during Gu (AMJ) season and an average of 250 mm Deyr (SON) season. Lower Jubba saw a general decreasing trend in rainfall during the Gu rainfall season, and a general increasing trend in the Deyr rainfall between 1981 to 2015 [20] . The Lower Jubba region has also experienced an increase in occurrence of depressed rainfall usually associated with drought, and a decrease in the frequency of above normal rainfall associated with floods [20] . Studies on the GHA show a decrease of MAM long rains and increase in the OND short rains [21] [22] [23] . Lower Jubba has seen increasing trends in the minimum, maximum and average temperature [20], consistent with the results from many recent studies worldwide [2] [24] [25] . Increase in temperature could also change the ecology of infectious diseases as well as increase temperature related mortality and morbidity of people and livestock [2] [26] [27] . Climate Change projections for Somalia will be used to derive information regarding the potential increase of the threats of climate extremes on future development and livelihoods. It will also enable the development of effective climate smart adaptation strategies. Details of area of study, data used and methodologies adopted are highlighted in the following sections. Gridded CHIRPS and GeoCLIM observations for the period 1960-90 were used as the baseline observations data. CHIRPS is a global dataset (50Ë\x9aS - 50Ë\x9aN, 180Ë\x9aE - 180Ë\x9aW), 0.05Ë\x9a resolution, 1981 to near-present gridded precipitation time series. CHIRPS data are produced by scientists at the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) Climate Hazard Group (CHG) and the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Earth Resources Observation and Science (EROS) Center. The data was developed to support the United States Agency for International Development Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET). Rainfall Measuring Mission Multi-satellite Precipitation Analysis version 7 (TMPA 3B42 v7) is used to calibrate global Cold Cloud Duration (CCD) rainfall estimates. Details on CHIRPS data and their usability in the region are well documented by ICPAC among many others [28] [29] . A coordinated set of the 20th and 21st century climate simulations for the Atmosphere Ocean coupled Global Climate Models (AOGCMs) in the Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5) have been contributed to by climate modelling groups from all around the world [30] . Data from the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) Africa framework was used in this study to project scenarios for precipitation in Lower Jubba. The CORDEX program is an initiative by World Climate Research Program (WCRP) of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) that generates high-resolution climate projections (50 km) for climate studies, within the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) timeline and beyond [31] [32] [33] . CORDEX data used in this study represented precipitation fairly well over the region and thus can be used to inform on adaptation and mitigation strategies [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] . These climate models describe the coupling of the atmosphere with the land surface, with differing dynamics and physics formulations [31] [37] . For each experiment the historical runs, forced by observed natural and anthropogenic atmospheric composition, cover the period from 1950-2005. The future projections (2006-2100) are forced with two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP), namely; RCP4.5 (mid-range emissions) and RCP8.5 (high-end emissions) scenarios, which prescribe future atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations and aerosols. Detail on the CORDEX RCMs can be found in Endris [32] and Nikulin [33] . Endris [32] evaluated the ability of the CORDEX RCMs in simulating the general characteristics of the climate over Eastern Africa region by analyzing the annual cycle, spatial variability, pattern correlation and root mean square error using a Taylor diagram. The study found that these RCMs reasonably simulate the main features of the rainfall climatology over eastern Africa and also reproduce the majority of the documented regional responses to ENSO and IOD forcings. At the same time the analysis showed significant biases in individual models depending on sub-region and season; however, the ensemble mean had better agreement with observation than individual models. The analysis concluded that the multi-model ensemble mean simulates eastern Africa rainfall adequately and could therefore be used for the assessment of future climate projections for the region. The CORDEX RCMs data was obtained from IGAD Climate Prediction and Application Centre (ICPAC) which is the WMO regional climate center for the Greater Horn of Africa. In this study the region of interest was Lower Jubba that is bounded by latitudes 1.5Ë\x9aS - 12.0Ë\x9aN and longitudes 41.0Ë\x9aE - 51.0Ë\x9aE. There IPCC based climate projection reference period were used namely 2030 (sub-period 1), sub-period up to 2050 (sub-period 2), and sub-period up to 2070 (sub-period 3). The study was divided into two major sections namely assessment of Model Skill in Simulating Observed Climate during the period 1961-1990, and the projection of future rainfall and temperature scenarios. Standard methods were adopted to determine the best climate model/s that could be used for the projection of future climate change scenarios for Lower Jubba region of Somalia for the two standard rainfall seasons Gu (April to June) and Deyr (September to November). The temperature simulations were for all standard seasons of the year in Somalia namely December-February (DJF), March-May (MAM), July-August (JJA), and September-November (SON). Standard methods were also adopted to test the spatial and temporal bias of the individual models. The methods used included various time series methods, correlation and regression analysis. Correlation methods examined correlations between the observed and simulated outputs at specific grid point locations. The square of the correlation coefficient is knows as coefficient of determination (r2) which represented the variance of the observed data that could be accounted for by the predicted variable. Regression method attempted to fit the best linear mathematical equation for the observed relationships. The statistical significance of the fitted linear regression trends were examined using graphical approaches as well as the standards statistical test that include the use of Mann-Kendall Rank Statistics. Similar methods have been adopted in many studies in Africa and the world at large [6] [20] [22] [24] [38] [39] [40] . A linear regression trend was investigated by examining the relationship between time (T) and the variable of interest (X), in this case rainfall, using the following equation X(t) is the individual observed seasonal rainfall/temperature during the baseline period 1960-1990, while Y(t) are corresponding values simulated by the individual CORDEX models over the period 1961-1990, c and b are normally the intercept and gradient (slope) of the regression equation. The slope indicates the average rate of change in the dependent variable in each year of the given time period. A positive/negative slope shows an increasing/decreasing trend respectively. The limitation of this method is that it assumes that all linkages between observed and CORDEX models generated models are linear, and the distributions of the observed and predicted records are normal. For non-normal data the study included nonparametric tests namely the Mann-Kendall rank statistics method was used. In the Mann-Kendall analysis data is ranked after being placed in time sequential order. The time series values (X1, X2, X3, X4 â\x80¦, Xn) where X in this case represents rainfall are replaced by their relative ranks (R1, R2, R3, R4 â\x80¦, Rn) (starting from the lowest value up to n). The relative magnitudes of sample data is compared rather than the data values themselves [41] [42] [43] . The equation used is as follows, where S is the Kendall score given a dataset R with a sample size of n values. The Kendall statistics s is given in Equation (2) below based on Kendall, 1938; 1945; 1948 The observed trend is significant if s values in Equation (2) have significance levels equal or less than 0.5. The ensemble model data was used in this study to compute the correlation value r and linear trend lines for each pixel for the individual seasons. The results for both correlation coefficient r value and the slope were mapped for each pixel and season. The results from the assessment of Model Skill in Simulating Observed Climate for the various seasons determined the models and seasons that were projected into the future using CORDEX RCA4.5 models. The three sub-periods used in the projections included the sub-periods up to 2030 (sub-period 1), up to 2050 (sub-period 2), and up to 2070 (sub-period 3). The results from model verification and climate change projections with CORDEX RCA4.5 models are independently highlighted in the following sections. The annual cycle of Gu (AMJ) and Deyr (SON) season rainfall for the baseline period 1960-90 from gridded CHIRPS observations and CORDEX RCMs simulated outputs were compared the study area in order to determine the best ensemble models that can be used for the future climate change rainfall projections. Future projections of temperature were undertaken for all the four standard seasons of the year. Figure 1(a) and Figure 1(b) illustrate the performance of CORDEX RCMs in simulating annual rainfall and temperature cycles over the study area as compared to the CHIRPS data. All of the RCMs capture fairly well the rainfall seasonality in Lower Jubba. Figure 1(a) shows that the north-south rainfall pattern follows the migration of the ITCZ, with associated locations of maximum rainfall being depicted fairly well by the ensemble model. For the study area, the ensemble mean results were found to simulate fairly well the annual rainfall cycle when compared to individual RCM models. In general, the study revealed some fairly good agreement between annual rainfall cycle simulated by ensemble of CORDEX RCMs and the CHIRPS data. The most notable shortcoming in most individual RCMs is the early peak and overestimation of the mean monthly rainfall particularly in the Deyr season (Figure 1(a)). Studies have shown that GCMs tend to overestimate rainfall in the Horn of Africa region during October to December season [2] [44] . IPCC reports have indicated limitation in the extent of skilful rainfall projection due to the nonlinear and chaotic nature of the climate system [2] . Results from the study showed that the ensemble models closely reproduced realistic representation of the observed climate features. Figure 1(b) shows the performance of CORDEX RCMs in simulating the mean surface temperature over Jubaland compared to the observed temperature data. The ensemble model seems to overestimate temperature when compared to the observed data during the hot months of Jan-April while underestimate during July to December, Figure 1(b). The results from the study indicated that the multi-model ensembles outperformed the individual RCM model as shown in Figure 2(a) and Figure 2(b). All of the RCMs however captured fairly well the rainfall seasonality in Lower Jubba, though significant biases can be found in individual models depending on the seasons as seen in Figure 2(a). The model bias for precipitation in each individual model varies from month to month. NOAA, CNRM and MPI and overestimated the rainfall data between August and November while MIROC underestimates the rainfall data in the same period. Figure 2(b) also showed variation in performance of the RCMs from month to month even with the temperature data. ICHEC underestimated the temperatures between January and June, while NOAA underestimated the data between July and December. MOCH and NCC overestimated the data in April. Similar results are from some previous studies for the Multi-model ensemble projections [2] [34] [35] [36] . It observed from the examination of the skill of the individual CORDEX models and ensemble models simulation observed CHIRPS and GEOCLIM data over the period 1961-1990 best during Gu (AMJ) season. Thus projection of future rainfall scenarios was undertaken for only the Gu (AMJ) season. The projections undertaken for temperature were observed for all seasons. It observed from the examination of the skill of the individual CORDEX models and ensemble models simulation observed CHIRPS and GEOCLIM data over the period 1961-1990 best during Gu (AMJ) season. Thus projection of future rainfall scenarios was undertaken for only the Gu (AMJ) season. The projections undertaken for temperature were observed for all seasons. The results for future projections of rainfall and temperature with the CORDEX RCMs are given below for IPCC sub periods of 2030, 2050 and 2070. The simulations of rainfall concentrated on the Gu (April-June) season, where most models showed more realistic simulations of rainfall. The geographical distribution exhibits notable spatial variability in rainfall over Lower Jubba. Badhaadhe district towards the southern coast exhibits the highest amount of rainfall as seen in Table 1. The southern costal region shows the highest projected amount of rainfall in Lower Jubba throughout all three sub-periods as was seen with the historical data published [20] . The patterns of the projected changes in seasonal ensemble mean Gu rainfall for the three sub-periods namely 2030, 2050 and 2070 showed significant variations in the magnitude of the projected seasonal rainfall from place to place, season, sub-periods and scenarios. There is a general increase in rainfall in Lower Jubba from 2030 to 2070. The projected rainfall is however not homogeneous throughout the region with the inland region receiving the least amount of rainfall. Similar results are reported in the Somali NAPA which shows an increase in rainfall in 2050 and 2080 [45] . This is also supported by IPCC studies that project an increase in MAM rainfall in 2050-2100 in most parts of Eastern Africa [2] . North eastern Kenya bordering Lower Jubba is projected to receive an increase in rainfall of 40% relative to the baseline period (1981-2010) by 2100 during its long rain season [46] . Table 1 shows the range of seasonal precipitation from the projected ensemble data for Gu, averaged over the districts in Jubaland, with RCP4.5 scenario for the three sub-periods 2030, 2050 and 2070. The observed trends of the temporal evolution of the projected precipitation over this region are shown in Figures 3(a)-(c). The results show a decreasing trend for the first sub-period Figure 3(a), followed by an increasing trend for the second and third sub-periods Figure 3(b) and Figure 3(c). The trends are however not statistically significant at a 95% confidence level. Despite being statistically insignificant the results are similar to those of studies over the region [1] [2] [47] . For Africa, IPCC projects that almost all countries except South Africa will probably experience a significant reduction in precipitation until 2050 which then increases significantly between 2050 and 2100 [2] corroborating the results displayed in Figures 3(a)-(c). The averaged mean water vapor, evaporation and precipitation are projected to increase globally by 2100 [1] [2] . The use of climate change knowledge, particularly when mainstreamed into planned policies and poverty reduction strategies can provide a starting point for the identification of climate risks at a district, regional and national level. The projected rainfall further shows dominant dry and wet phases of the Gu season in the future (Figure 4), which calls for sustained investment in early warning mechanisms, and water management systems. The spatial representation of the projected rainfall trends showed no homogenous patterns throughout the three study sub periods. While some areas in Lower Jubba are projected to have general decrease in rainfall during the long rain season, other areas were projected to have a general increase in rainfall (Table 2). General increasing trend was however seen throughout Lower Jubba, with different magnitude of the changes. Details of the pattern in the trend in each district can be seen in Table 2. Although the projected rainfall trends were still not statistically significant, the complexity of the observed characteristics of the changes continues to call for further studies and tailored mitigation and adaptation strategies over the region of study. Individual rainfall time series shown in Figure 5 further indicate general dominance of depressed rainfall during the sub period ending in 2030, followed with dominance of positive rainfall anomalies during the last two sub-periods ending in 2050 and 2070. These results signify the need for investment in early warning mechanisms in Lower Jubba. Results on Lower Jubba are similar to projected results for Africa, where the impacts of climate change will be exacerbated by widespread poverty, diseases and high population growth rates, which would intensify the demand for food, water and livestock [47] [48] . The projected recurrence of depressed rainfall for the near future is significant for a country that is already highly vulnerable with high poverty levels across multiple dimensions [49] . Somalia is already experiencing food insecurity, the implication of a further risk to food and water security could pause a threat on security in a struggle for available resources. Furthermore, results from this study have shown that communities in Lower Jubba revert to charcoal production when their livelihoods are threatened, the impact of which is forest degradation. The recurrence of extreme below normal rainfall often associated with drought is also evident, given the communities use of charcoal as an adaptation strategy, an increase in deforestation and degradation can be expected. The projected precipitation presented in this study call for urgency in finding short and mid-term solutions. The increase in above average rainfall associated with floods as seen in Figure 4 by in sub-period 2 (2050) is also consistent with Tierney, et al. and IPCC that projects increased precipitation in Africa generally during the same period [1] [2] [47] . The magnitude of the extreme above and below average rainfall for the projected future is not the same as seen in Figure 4. Similar results in the bordering regions in Kenya, project an increase in intensity of rainfall, and extreme rainfall events [46] . The spatial pattern of the projected seasonal ensemble mean surface temperature based on the RCMs are shown for the three sub-periods namely 2030, 2050 and 2070 relative to the baseline period showed general warming at most locations over the three sub periods ending in 2030, 2050 and 2070. Results however show that projected change in temperature will vary from season to season and district to district. Like the observed GISTEMP data [20], the average temperature seems to increase towards the southern costal band in all seasons, possibly due to influence by Indian Ocean [50] . The ensemble models however seemed to overestimate the temperature in JJA which according to the observed data [20] should register the lowest temperature. Results from the temperature time series (Figure 6) show an increasing temperatures in both the near to long term future. This is in line with global and regional reports that project an increase in the average temperature by 2030 and a further increase by 2050 [2] [24] [25] [44] [51] . Results are statistically significant at 95% confidence level. Changes in temperature and humidity are reportedly linked to increased vector borne diseases and helminthes infections [52] . This will also have far reaching implications on many socio-economic sectors. Figure 5 shows the anomalies in the projected temperature time series. Results are similar to IPCC [2] reports projecting more hot and fewer cold temperature extremes in most places as global mean temperatures increase in a seasonal time scale. Results showed the rate of increase in temperature by 0.3 to 0.7 degrees by 2035. The unique patterns of the temperature time series is the tendencies for the annual temperature extremes to be generally higher that the preceding years. WMO recent observations have shown such tendencies in the recent years for the annual mean temperature time series. In general, the projections for Lower Jubba indicated an increase in minimum and maximum temperatures in all seasons in the projection periods 2030, 2050 and 2070. Temperature projections are critical in the development of effective and realistic climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction strategies. The impact of an increasing temperature would be far reaching for most socio-economic sectors including community safety, water, food, energy, infrastructure, among others [26] [53] [54] . The projected temperature would also exacerbate health issues with heat related morbidity and mortality in Africa being projected to increase [26] [27] [53] [54] [55] . Studies have also projected that the geographical distribution of disease prone areas like Malaria will increase as climatic conditions change, creating more conducive conditions for new diseases to breed in areas that were previously disease free [53] [55] [56] [57] . Projected rainfall change patterns indicated significant increase in high rainfall extremes were exhibited in periods leading up to 2050 and 2070. In the case of temperature, the projections from all the models showed increase in minimum and maximum temperatures in all seasons and sub periods, like being observed temperature projection over other parts of the world. Most of livelihoods and the socio-economic activities in Somalia are dependent on water availability from rainfall. The 2030, 2050 and 2070 projected rainfall and temperature change scenarios show that Somalia future development and livelihoods in future will face increased threats of climate extremes unless effective climate smart adaptation systems form integral components of national development strategies. With the prolonging socio economic stability in the country, the development of the required community based effective climate smart adaptation systems will require support from global and regional partners. Efforts to achieve food security in Somalia have long been hampered by climate extremes such as floods and drought, as well as civil wars, political volatility, rapid population growth, among other miseries [4] [23] [58] [59] . Most of the socio-economic activities in Lower Jubba are rain dependent. Recurring drought and floods cause acute stress on a developing economy such as that of Lower Jubba. Flooding in Lower Jubba has been linked to RVF outbreaks which in the past has resulted in a ban in the export of livestock from Somalia and led to massive losses for communities and the Somali economy [60] [61] [62] . Rainfall variability, particularly the projected recurrence of below average extremes in the near future would also impact the rate of restoration of disturbed vegetation. Temperature anomalies indicate recurrences of positive anomalies within all the three projected periods except for OND where some negative anomalies were evident during the first projection period. Seasonal differences, in the observed temperature projections, were quite evident and are major issues that require more studies in order to develop effective and realistic climate change and disaster risk reduction strategies. Long term adaptation planning by the Jubaland Administration for Lower Jubba must take an integrated approach to both floods and drought for both the near, mid and far future. Investment in early warning systems for daily, monthly, seasonal and inter-annual prediction is critical for any effective adaptation strategy. Timely seasonal forecasts and drought monitoring is essential for drought risk reduction in Lower Jubba where livelihoods are closely intertwined with climate variability. The study further provides some important knowledge on rainfall variability and change over the Lower Jubba region that would contribute to the 6th IPCC assessment report on the state of regional climate change over Africa. The knowledge on the past, present and future rainfall patterns derived from this study is important in the development of any effective disaster risk reduction and climate change strategies of Somalia in supporting sustainable development goals, implementation of the Paris UNFCCC, Sendai disaster risk reduction, among other global, regional, national and community based resilience building frameworks.', 'summary': "[ ' K e y w o r d s :     I n c r e a s i n g   e v i d e n c e   i s   a b l e   t o   l i n k   c l i m a t e   c h a n g e   t o   m a j o r   a n d   m i n o r   t h r e a t s   t o   n a t u r a l   s y s t e m s ,   t h r e a t e n i n g   e n v i r o n m e n t a l ,   s o c i a l   a n d   e c o n o m i c   d e v e l o p m e n t   [ 1 ]   [ 2 ]   .

Positive tendencies in the frequency of occurrence and duration of heat waves, as well as in the amount of rain associated with extreme events are observed in more areas than negative trends. Unfortunately such results are of medium confidence due to insufficient data and studies in the region. For North America, Central America, Europe and Mediterranean results are more conclusive and show with high confidence the unequivocal warming. According to the IPCC, the air temperature at the surface (ocean and continent) measured globally increased by 0.85Ë\x9aC over the period 1880-2012. In this paper, some of the indicators of climatic extremes presented by the IPCC are used to compose the proposed Climate Change Index (CCI) whose objective is to indicate the degree of future susceptibility to cli- matic extremes in a given region. The CCI, along with other indices of biophysical susceptibility and socioeconomic vulnerability is used to comprise the synthesized Vulnerability Index (VI) for climatic extremes [2] . The VI seeks to identify vulnerabilities to climatic extremes of different dimensions that make certain regions sus- ceptible to the impacts of climate change, with possible future exacerbations beyond what is happening at present. The methodology used to construct the CCI reflects in a great extend the methodology used in the report â\x80\x9cMap of the Vulnerability of the People of the State of Rio de Janeiro to the Impacts of Climate Change upon Social, Health and Environmental Areasâ\x80\x9d authored by FIOCRUZ and SEA-RJ 2011 [3] . In this report mean values of air temperature and precipitation are used. The present research opted for five indicators of climatic extremes as opposed to averages, since studies have shown an amplification of extremes in recent decades, despite the fact that climatological mean values have suffered little change [4] . Moreover, changes in extremes, as pointed out by the [1] , have a much bigger impact on society and ecosystems in general than the increase in average values [5] -[7] . The proposed methodology is applied to the state of Paraná, which was initiated by the study on the detection of climate change, considering indicators of climatic extremes from observational data from the Agronomic In- stitute of Paraná [8] . The methodology and data used to calculate the CCI are given in Section 2; the results of applying the methodology to the state of Paraná are presented in Section 3; and the conclusions in Section 4. The meteorological data for the calculation of indicators of climatic extremes used to construct the CCI are ob- tained from simulations from the Eta regional model with horizontal resolution of 40 km by 40 km. The regional Eta model [9] was nested inside the HadCM3 global coupled model [10] . This downscaling of global model si- mulations of the HadCM3 Eta model for South America will be called Eta-HadCM3. For present climate condi- tions (1961-1990) the CO2 concentration was considered to be 330 ppm, and for the future (2041-2070) climate, the emission scenario from the A1B Special Report on Emission Scenarios was used-SRES [11] . Four integra- tions were made with the Eta-HadCM3, generated from perturbations of the physics of the HadCM3 model. Among these four runs two were used in this study, one member (or scenario) which showed the highest climate sensitivity at the end of the century, to be referred to here as â\x80\x9chighâ\x80\x9d, and another member which had the lowest climate sensitivity, to be called â\x80\x9clowâ\x80\x9d. The climate sensitivity is based on the change in global temperature. The use of these two runs was an attempt to span the possible variations that the HadCM3 model produced in its global simulations. According to [12] , although the four runs all correspond to the A1B emission scenario, the projections of temperature increase resulting from each of the runs show similarities to increases characteristic of scenarios of low (B1) and high emission (A2 or A1FI). Reference [13] evaluated the simulations of the Eta-HadCM3 model for South America and showed good agreement between the simulations of the present climate and the observational data, suggesting adequacy of the model for studies of climate change in South America. Reference [12] evaluated the climate projections of the Eta-HadCM3 model for South America for the future climate. The projections indicate a strong warming (between 4Ë\x9aC and 6Ë\x9aC) on the South American continent and strong reductions of rainfall in Amazonia and Northeast Brazil (reaching up to 40% compared to the present). All model projections point to more intense changes after 2041, indicating a drier and warmer climate in the ba- sins of the Amazon, São Francisco and Paraná rivers, with small changes in precipitation for the last of these. The variables used for the calculation of indicators of climatic extremesâ\x80\x94air temperature every 6 hours and daily precipitationâ\x80\x94are extracted from each of the 216 gridpoints of the Eta-HadCM3 model simulations over Paraná, with each point covering 40 × 40 km2 of the territory of this state, as shown in Figure 1. For each model grid point, the indicators of climatic extremes are calculated for air temperature and precipita- tion from the present climate (1961-1990) and the future climate (2041-2070), for the â\x80\x9chighâ\x80\x9d and â\x80\x9clowâ\x80\x9d mem- bers. The choice of a future period at an intermediate distance between 2011 and 2099 is due to the fact that, a future that is too distant, such as 2100, makes things more difficult for political decision-makers trying to grasp such a time span. In the present research, five indicators of climatic extremes were selected from among those developed by the Expert Team on Climate Change Detection Monitoring and Indices (ETCCDMI), established by the Commis- sion for Climatology of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and by the CLIVAR Climate Variabil- ity and Predictability Program to make viable a global analysis of climate extremes. The five indicators of climatic extremes used in this research are: annual rainfall totals for rainy days, i.e., days when rainfall is greater than or equal to 1 mm (PRCPTOT, in mm); total annual rainfall on days when rain- fall is greater than that of the 95th percentile of the rainy days (R95p, in mm); maximum number of consecutive dry days for the year, that is, the days on which rainfall is less than 1 mm (CDD, in days) and annual mean maxi- mum (TMAXmean) and minimum (TMINmean) temperatures, in degrees Celsius. These indicators are gener- ated with the aid of the RClimdex program [14] , formulated in Canada and designed specifically to calculate climatic extremes. The term â\x80\x9cclimatic anomalyâ\x80\x9d as used in this study is the absolute difference of the changes projected by the model for the future climate relative to its current climate. The outputs of the program RClimdex provide an annual value for each of the five indicators analyzed. Initially obtained for each grid point are the average values of the present (1961-1990) and future (2041-2070) period for PRCPTOT, R95p, CDD, TMAXmean and TMIN mean. Next we compute the â\x80\x9canomaliesâ\x80\x9d as shown in Equation (1), obtaining the value of APRCPTOT, AR95p, ACDD, and ATMAXmean and ATMINmean at each grid point in the model. where AEXT represents the anomaly of the indicator of a climatic extreme and the bar represents the mean val- ue of EXT in the period considered. In addition to calculating climatic anomalies as described in Equation (1), we proceeded to normalize them, i.e., the â\x80\x9cclimatic anomaliesâ\x80\x9d were also divided by their respective standard deviations (Equation (2)) calculated from the present climate. The â\x80\x9cnormalized climatic anomalyâ\x80\x9d (Equation (3)) reflects more effectively the impact of future climate change in relation to the present climate. In other words, the degree of stress due to a future climate change depends on the variability experienced in the present climate. This interpretation of â\x80\x9cstandard climatic anomalyâ\x80\x9d leads to the inference that the greater the present variability (standard deviation), the less the effect of stress felt due to future variation, because it is expected that populations and ecosystems would al- ready be accustomed to the variability in a given phenomenon, and therefore are already adapted to it. where is the total number of years, EXT are the values of the indicators of climatic extremes (PRCPTOT, R95p, CDD, TMAXmean and TMINmean) for each year, DPEXT is the standard deviation of the indicator of climatic extreme and is the normalized anomaly of the indicator of the climatic extreme. Despite the advantages of standardization as described above, the analyses related purely to â\x80\x9cclimatic anoma- liesâ\x80\x9d (without normalization) are maintained here in order to stress the absolute magnitude of the changes pro- jected for the future (2041-2070) in relation to the present (1961-1990) for air temperature and precipitation. After the calculation of the â\x80\x9cnormalized climatic anomaliesâ\x80\x9d for each indicator of an extreme at each grid point in the state of Paraná, these are divided into classes. The division into classes considers the lowest and highest value of the â\x80\x9cnormalized anomaliesâ\x80\x9d of the five indicators of extremes obtained at all model grid points for each of the two members, â\x80\x9chighâ\x80\x9d and â\x80\x9clowâ\x80\x9d. For each of the classes a score is assigned ranging from 0 to 1, with a score of 0 attributed to the smallest and 1 to the largest with respect to the standard deviation. In order to obtain the indicators of normalized climatic extremes for each of the 399 municipalities in the state of Paraná, the Grid Analyst ArcGIS 10.1 program was used, with the aid of the Extract Value Grid with Polygon command. The polygon in this case is the geographic representation of each municipality that is superimposed on the contours resulting from the interpolation of the grid data. This process of â\x80\x9cmunicipalizationâ\x80\x9d generates for each municipality in Paraná a normalized anomaly indicator for each of the five chosen parameters. The Climate Change Index (CCI) is represented by the highest score of the class of anomalies among the five indicators of climate extremes for the â\x80\x9chighâ\x80\x9d and â\x80\x9clowâ\x80\x9d members, as shown in Equation (4). This is achieved with the understanding that when one of the variables under analysis presents a significant climatic anomaly, be it temperature, precipitation or drought stress, this is sufficient to characterize the susceptibility to future climate change, so that the calculation of the average anomalies cannot mischaracterize the intensity of anomalies and underestimate important critical aspects. In this section the methodology proposed for the calculation of the CCI is presented for the state of Paraná. The results and maps obtained give indications of the anomalies of the climatic extremes in the state for the â\x80\x9chighâ\x80\x9d member, projected for the period 2041-2070. Initially, the distribution of the anomalies of the climatic extremes associated with precipitation and air temperature is analyzed. In Figures 2-4, the anomaly strips are shown for the indicators of climatic extremes of precipitation, which in- cludes APRCPTOT, AR95P and ACDD, for the â\x80\x9chighâ\x80\x9d member. It is noted on the maps of APRCPTOT and R95p a similar pattern of anomaly, with increased rainfall in almost the entire region studied, intensifying from north to south in the state. The total annual rainfall on wet days (PRCPTOT) projected from 2041 to 2070 (rela- tive to 1961-1990) shows an average increase ranging from 15 mm in the north to 466 mm in the south, includ- ing the coast. In regard to ACDD higher values can be seen, indicating dry periods that are longer in the north- east but fall off towards the southwest coast of the state. In the northeast of the state it is projected for 2041- 2070 an average increase of about 7 days in the duration of periods of consecutive dry days. For the extremes of temperature (ATMAXmean and ATMINmean), a projection of warming throughout the state is noted, with the largest increases of temperature in the northeast, approximately 4Ë\x9aC in the â\x80\x9chighâ\x80\x9d mem ber, decreasing in the direction of the coast. This indicates that the present-day rate of increase of TMAXmean and TMINmean, which is statistically significant at +0.02Ë\x9aC/year [8] , will be intensified in the future. In order to facilitate the interpretation of the CCI, the predominant anomalies were grouped into three categories: 1) precipitation anomaly, grouping the anomalies of APRCPTOT and AR95p; 2) anomaly of hydrologicstress, which is the same as the anomaly ACDD; and 3) temperature anomaly, composed of the maximum (ATMAX- mean) and minimum (ATMINmean) temperature anomalies. Table 1 shows the average for each indicator of extreme climate throughout the state of Paraná from its nor- malized anomalies. We note that with the normalization of extreme weather anomalies projected for 2041-2070, the prevailing anomaly happens to be, for the most part, related to extremes of temperature, with the minimum temperature () having the greatest influence. The temperature anomaly (and) in the municipalities was significantly larger than all the weather extremes analyzed. For the â\x80\x9chighâ\x80\x9d scenario the projected ATMINmean is 6.79 times larger than its standard deviation in the present climate, while all the mean precipitation anomalies, whether in the â\x80\x9chighâ\x80\x9d or â\x80\x9clowâ\x80\x9d scenario, had values below 1, indicating impacts of little relevance. In other words, the expected future precipitation variability is current already. The distribution of the number of municipalities in Paraná in each score class is shown in Table 2, where it can be seen that even in the â\x80\x9clowâ\x80\x9d scenario the scores are greater than 0.4 and in the â\x80\x9chighâ\x80\x9d scenario 98% of the scores are concentrated between 0.8 and 1. The maps of the normalized anomalies of climatic extremes in the â\x80\x9chighâ\x80\x9d member are shown in Figure 5, ex- cept for and which were omitted because of no indications of large variations in their spatial patterns. values (figure not shown) are very high in almost the entire state, with scores in the class 0.8 - 1.0, except only around the municipality of Telêmaco Borba in the Serra do Cadeado, where the class is slightly lower, between 0.6 and 0.8. Regarding (Figure 6), most of the municipalities show strong anomalies (scoring at 0.6 to 0.8), with a group of 16 municipalities in the far Central-South region showing very strong anomalies (score at 0.8 to 1). With regard to the three indicators analyzed that characterize extremes precipitation, , and, all are low or moderately low in most part of the state. shows a group of municipalities with moderately low index, between 0.2 and 0.4, located in the Southeastern region and some municipalities in the far Southwest of the state (see Figure 7). AR95p showed low intensity (score 0 to 0.2). As for this also showed a group of municipalities with moderately low index in the class from 0.2 to 0.4, also located in the Eastern region of the state, excluding the municipalities at the coast at the Serra do Mar (Fig- ure 8). Superposing the maps of (Figure 8) and (Figure 7) it can be observed that there is a subgroup of 47 municipalities in the south/southeast that is prominent in changing the distribution of preci- pitation, showing an increase in PRCPTOT as well as in CDD, albeit with moderately low intensity (Figure 9). In other words, these municipalities will experience a major shift in the distribution of rainfall, with greatest to- tal annual rainfall and longer dry periods in the future (Figure 9). The municipalities have values of APRCPTOT between 0.4 and 0.6 and ACDD between 0.2 and 0.4. Table 3 groups the municipalities by class of scores of standardized climatic extremes. It appears that in general, the effects of anomalies related to rain (, , and) are of little importance in most municipalities, concentrated as they are in the lowest class of scores (i.e., 0 to 0.2) of low intensity. This is due to the fact that the projected magnitude of the anomaly of precipitation extremes fits within the respective standard deviation of the precipitation extreme of the present climate. Table 3 shows that the greatest susceptibility to future climate change will most likely fall on the minimum temperature, with 394 municipalities (99%) having a very intense anomaly (in the â\x80\x9chighâ\x80\x9d member) with maximum score between 0.8 and 1, corresponding to an increase in the minimum temperature of 6 to 8 times the present-day standard deviation of minimum temperature. The second largest anomaly is very likely to be the maximum temperature (also in the high member) where 16 municipalities have a very intense anomaly, with maximum score from 0.8 to 1 and 374 municipalities (94%) characterized as intense, with a relatively high score, between 0.6 and 0.8, which corresponds to a maximum temperature increase of 5 to 6 times the standard deviation of maximum temperature experienced at present. It should be emphasized that it was established in the methodology of the CCI that if the municipality exhibits only one of the indicators of elevated climatic anomaly, this is sufficient to characterize it as susceptible to a fu- ture climatic anomaly. Consequently, it is concluded that virtually all municipalities in the state will be suscepti- ble to climate change due to their susceptibility to anomalies of maximum and minimum temperatures prevailing in the case of high sensitivity to emissions of greenhouse gases from the A1B scenario. The Climatic Change Index (CCI) is calculated for each municipality, where the analysis of the five climate ex- treme indicators jointly makes apparent the profile of the intensity of the projected anomalies. Figure 10 below is an example of a â\x80\x9cradarâ\x80\x9d chart analysis for the municipality of União da Vitória as an illustration of this kind of visualization. The municipality of União da Vitória is situated in the Central South of the State and, as already mentioned, is part of the group of municipalities with high (moderately low, score = 0.26, while at the same time there is an increase in ACDD, also moderately low in the â\x80\x9chighâ\x80\x9d scenario (â\x80\x9chighâ\x80\x9d, score = 0.21). However, what stands out most for the municipality is the high intensity of the impact of the temperature ano- maly in the â\x80\x9chighâ\x80\x9d member. União da Vitória is one of the municipalities of the group most impacted in the high member with CCI â\x80\x9chighâ\x80\x9d above 0.85 and CCI â\x80\x9clowâ\x80\x9d equal to 0.63. In the â\x80\x9chighâ\x80\x9d member, the impact appears very intense for both the minimum temperature (â\x80\x9chighâ\x80\x9d, score = 0.85) and for the maximum tempera- ture (â\x80\x9chighâ\x80\x9d, score = 0.81). The score â\x80\x9chighâ\x80\x9d of 0.85 represents an anomaly of about six times the standard deviation of the present-day minimum temperature. In this paper we propose the use of a Climate Change Index (CCI) to assess the degree of susceptibility of a re- gion to future climate extremes associated with the air temperature and precipitation. The advantage of this in- dex is the possibility of synthesizing various extreme climatic indicators into a single index in a standardized way. The methodology used to calculate the CCI is based on projections of indicators of climate extremes for a fu- ture period of two climatic scenarios (low and high emission) normalized in relation to their values in the pre- sent climate. The indicators of climatic extremes used are: total annual precipitation for days with rain, i.e., days when rainfall is equal to or greater than 1 mm (PRCPTOT, in mm); total annual rainfall on the days when rainfall is greater than the 95th percentile of the rainy days (R95p, in mm); maximum number of consecutive dry days in the year, or days in which precipitation is less than 1 mm (CDD, in days); and annual averages of maximum (TMAXmean) and minimum (TMINmean) temperatures, in degrees Celsius. The methodology was applied to the state of Paraná from regionalized Eta-HadCM3 projections for the present (1961-1990) and future (2041-2070). The results show an alleged increase in PRCPTOT for the period 2041-2070 as compared to the period 1961-1990, referred as the present climate by the RCM, that is projected to range from 25 mm in the northern part of the state to 465 mm in the south. Likewise, R95p will also increase in the future, following the same spa- tial pattern as PRCPTOT. On the other hand, an increase in CDD is projected, which means longer dry periods. This shows that if the projections prove accurate, then in the decades of 2041-2070 rainfall will be poorly dis- tributed, with stronger and/or more frequent intense rainfall events and longer dry periods. Analysis of the CCI makes clear that differences of projected extreme rainfall (total rainfall, heavy rain and water stress) are insignificant in view of the differences of projected extreme temperatures, since the change in future precipitation falls within the range of present variability. Conversely, the differences of projected extreme temperatures (both minimum and maximum) are likely to range between 2 to 7 times greater than the present variations. In terms of comparison between the two members, the indicators of climatic extremes in the â\x80\x9chighâ\x80\x9d member are in general stronger than those in the â\x80\x9clowâ\x80\x9d member, with a larger number of municipalities with increased vulnerability in the â\x80\x9chighâ\x80\x9d member, in the A1B emission scenario. In terms of location of climate vulnerability within the state, practically all of the state in the â\x80\x9chighâ\x80\x9d member, is found to be in the class with the highest score (CCI > 0.8), which means very intense susceptibility, due to the increase projected in minimum temperatures. These inferences, although preliminary, give indications of the need for preventive actions necessary over the medium and long term, by municipal and state authorities, such as the adaptation of crops, infrastructure, build- ings, and changing of practices and behaviors to cope with projected climatic anomalies. Large strides are being made in the improvement of global and regional models, with increasing accurate re- sults for mapping climate sensitivity and vulnerability. Likewise, in methodological terms, the indicators of climatic extremes selected for the calculation of the CCI can be adjusted to better represent future climate sensitivities to be faced in different states.', 'summary': "[ ' T h e   t e r m   â \\ x 8 0 \\ x 9 c c l i m a t i c   a n o m a l y â \\ x 8 0 \\ x 9 d   a s   u s e d   i n   t h i s   s t u d y   i s   t h e   a b s o l u t e   d i f f e r e n c e   o f   t h e   c h a n g e s   p r o j e c t e d   b y   t h e   m o d e l   f o r   t h e   f u t u r e   c l i m a t e   r e l a t i v e   t o   i t s   c u r r e n t   c l i m a t e .

In Sub-Saharan Africa, vulnerability to climate change for local communities is increased because of their dependence on rain fed agriculture [3] [4] [5] [6] . Large populations in Somalia in particular have experienced severer impacts due to water stress as their livelihoods are dependent on access to water and pasture [7] [8] . 94% of nomadic populations in Somalia are reportedly living in poverty. Somaliaâ\x80\x99s long coastal line provides fishing livelihood systems threatened by unique marine systems that include Somalia ocean currents systems, tropical cyclones and before tropical cyclones. Somalia has seen an increase in frequency and intensity of floods and droughts with severe droughts in 2007/2008, 2011/2012, 2015/16/17 [9] . Climate induced displacement in Somalia continues to increase with UN listing the number of internally displaced persons due to drought between November 2016 and October 2017 at 943,000 [10] . Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (2015-2030) recognized the difficulty in achieving sustainable development without the development of climate smart systems. Climate change impacts are projected to slow down economic growth, making poverty reduction even more difficult, while prolonging existing poverty traps [2] . Climate change risks undermine the sustainability of basic livelihoods, threatening food security, health among other socio-economic impacts. Without proper adaptation measures, the projected increase in frequency and severity of weather and climate extremes will undermine the safety of ecosystems and health [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . The need to strengthen Somaliaâ\x80\x99s capacity to deal with disasters, such as the protracted droughts and floods that it continues to face, is critical [16] . The study attempted to provide projected rainfall and temperature change scenarios for Lower Jubba region, Somalia. This was done using the downscaled Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) RCMs data. The annual rainfall and temperature cycles simulated by an ensemble of CORDEX RCMs were compared with the observed data. The analysis focused on the Gu long rain season, which had the best agreement in comparison to the observed rainfall data. Projections for temperature were done for all the standard global climatological seasons namely northern hemisphere summer, winter, autumn and spring seasons that correspond to June to August, December to February, September to November, March to May months. The projections of the future Gu long rain season characteristics was done using the IPCC projected periods of 2030, 2050 and 2070 benchmarks. Lower Jubba is located in the Jubaland state of Somalia [17] [18] . Jubaland consists of the Gedo, Lower Jubba and Middle Jubba regions, and lies 40 - 60 km east of the Jubba River, stretching from Gedo to the Indian Ocean. The state of Jubaland borders the Garrisa, Wajir and Mandera County of Kenya on the western side. Kismayo, located in Lower Jubba, is the largest city in Jubaland, and the third largest city in Somalia after Mogadishu and Hargesa [19] . Lower Jubba receives about 350 mm rainfall during Gu (AMJ) season and an average of 250 mm Deyr (SON) season. Lower Jubba saw a general decreasing trend in rainfall during the Gu rainfall season, and a general increasing trend in the Deyr rainfall between 1981 to 2015 [20] . The Lower Jubba region has also experienced an increase in occurrence of depressed rainfall usually associated with drought, and a decrease in the frequency of above normal rainfall associated with floods [20] . Studies on the GHA show a decrease of MAM long rains and increase in the OND short rains [21] [22] [23] . Lower Jubba has seen increasing trends in the minimum, maximum and average temperature [20], consistent with the results from many recent studies worldwide [2] [24] [25] . Increase in temperature could also change the ecology of infectious diseases as well as increase temperature related mortality and morbidity of people and livestock [2] [26] [27] . Climate Change projections for Somalia will be used to derive information regarding the potential increase of the threats of climate extremes on future development and livelihoods. It will also enable the development of effective climate smart adaptation strategies. Details of area of study, data used and methodologies adopted are highlighted in the following sections. Gridded CHIRPS and GeoCLIM observations for the period 1960-90 were used as the baseline observations data. CHIRPS is a global dataset (50Ë\x9aS - 50Ë\x9aN, 180Ë\x9aE - 180Ë\x9aW), 0.05Ë\x9a resolution, 1981 to near-present gridded precipitation time series. CHIRPS data are produced by scientists at the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) Climate Hazard Group (CHG) and the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Earth Resources Observation and Science (EROS) Center. The data was developed to support the United States Agency for International Development Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET). Rainfall Measuring Mission Multi-satellite Precipitation Analysis version 7 (TMPA 3B42 v7) is used to calibrate global Cold Cloud Duration (CCD) rainfall estimates. Details on CHIRPS data and their usability in the region are well documented by ICPAC among many others [28] [29] . A coordinated set of the 20th and 21st century climate simulations for the Atmosphere Ocean coupled Global Climate Models (AOGCMs) in the Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5) have been contributed to by climate modelling groups from all around the world [30] . Data from the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) Africa framework was used in this study to project scenarios for precipitation in Lower Jubba. The CORDEX program is an initiative by World Climate Research Program (WCRP) of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) that generates high-resolution climate projections (50 km) for climate studies, within the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) timeline and beyond [31] [32] [33] . CORDEX data used in this study represented precipitation fairly well over the region and thus can be used to inform on adaptation and mitigation strategies [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] . These climate models describe the coupling of the atmosphere with the land surface, with differing dynamics and physics formulations [31] [37] . For each experiment the historical runs, forced by observed natural and anthropogenic atmospheric composition, cover the period from 1950-2005. The future projections (2006-2100) are forced with two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP), namely; RCP4.5 (mid-range emissions) and RCP8.5 (high-end emissions) scenarios, which prescribe future atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations and aerosols. Detail on the CORDEX RCMs can be found in Endris [32] and Nikulin [33] . Endris [32] evaluated the ability of the CORDEX RCMs in simulating the general characteristics of the climate over Eastern Africa region by analyzing the annual cycle, spatial variability, pattern correlation and root mean square error using a Taylor diagram. The study found that these RCMs reasonably simulate the main features of the rainfall climatology over eastern Africa and also reproduce the majority of the documented regional responses to ENSO and IOD forcings. At the same time the analysis showed significant biases in individual models depending on sub-region and season; however, the ensemble mean had better agreement with observation than individual models. The analysis concluded that the multi-model ensemble mean simulates eastern Africa rainfall adequately and could therefore be used for the assessment of future climate projections for the region. The CORDEX RCMs data was obtained from IGAD Climate Prediction and Application Centre (ICPAC) which is the WMO regional climate center for the Greater Horn of Africa. In this study the region of interest was Lower Jubba that is bounded by latitudes 1.5Ë\x9aS - 12.0Ë\x9aN and longitudes 41.0Ë\x9aE - 51.0Ë\x9aE. There IPCC based climate projection reference period were used namely 2030 (sub-period 1), sub-period up to 2050 (sub-period 2), and sub-period up to 2070 (sub-period 3). The study was divided into two major sections namely assessment of Model Skill in Simulating Observed Climate during the period 1961-1990, and the projection of future rainfall and temperature scenarios. Standard methods were adopted to determine the best climate model/s that could be used for the projection of future climate change scenarios for Lower Jubba region of Somalia for the two standard rainfall seasons Gu (April to June) and Deyr (September to November). The temperature simulations were for all standard seasons of the year in Somalia namely December-February (DJF), March-May (MAM), July-August (JJA), and September-November (SON). Standard methods were also adopted to test the spatial and temporal bias of the individual models. The methods used included various time series methods, correlation and regression analysis. Correlation methods examined correlations between the observed and simulated outputs at specific grid point locations. The square of the correlation coefficient is knows as coefficient of determination (r2) which represented the variance of the observed data that could be accounted for by the predicted variable. Regression method attempted to fit the best linear mathematical equation for the observed relationships. The statistical significance of the fitted linear regression trends were examined using graphical approaches as well as the standards statistical test that include the use of Mann-Kendall Rank Statistics. Similar methods have been adopted in many studies in Africa and the world at large [6] [20] [22] [24] [38] [39] [40] . A linear regression trend was investigated by examining the relationship between time (T) and the variable of interest (X), in this case rainfall, using the following equation X(t) is the individual observed seasonal rainfall/temperature during the baseline period 1960-1990, while Y(t) are corresponding values simulated by the individual CORDEX models over the period 1961-1990, c and b are normally the intercept and gradient (slope) of the regression equation. The slope indicates the average rate of change in the dependent variable in each year of the given time period. A positive/negative slope shows an increasing/decreasing trend respectively. The limitation of this method is that it assumes that all linkages between observed and CORDEX models generated models are linear, and the distributions of the observed and predicted records are normal. For non-normal data the study included nonparametric tests namely the Mann-Kendall rank statistics method was used. In the Mann-Kendall analysis data is ranked after being placed in time sequential order. The time series values (X1, X2, X3, X4 â\x80¦, Xn) where X in this case represents rainfall are replaced by their relative ranks (R1, R2, R3, R4 â\x80¦, Rn) (starting from the lowest value up to n). The relative magnitudes of sample data is compared rather than the data values themselves [41] [42] [43] . The equation used is as follows, where S is the Kendall score given a dataset R with a sample size of n values. The Kendall statistics s is given in Equation (2) below based on Kendall, 1938; 1945; 1948 The observed trend is significant if s values in Equation (2) have significance levels equal or less than 0.5. The ensemble model data was used in this study to compute the correlation value r and linear trend lines for each pixel for the individual seasons. The results for both correlation coefficient r value and the slope were mapped for each pixel and season. The results from the assessment of Model Skill in Simulating Observed Climate for the various seasons determined the models and seasons that were projected into the future using CORDEX RCA4.5 models. The three sub-periods used in the projections included the sub-periods up to 2030 (sub-period 1), up to 2050 (sub-period 2), and up to 2070 (sub-period 3). The results from model verification and climate change projections with CORDEX RCA4.5 models are independently highlighted in the following sections. The annual cycle of Gu (AMJ) and Deyr (SON) season rainfall for the baseline period 1960-90 from gridded CHIRPS observations and CORDEX RCMs simulated outputs were compared the study area in order to determine the best ensemble models that can be used for the future climate change rainfall projections. Future projections of temperature were undertaken for all the four standard seasons of the year. Figure 1(a) and Figure 1(b) illustrate the performance of CORDEX RCMs in simulating annual rainfall and temperature cycles over the study area as compared to the CHIRPS data. All of the RCMs capture fairly well the rainfall seasonality in Lower Jubba. Figure 1(a) shows that the north-south rainfall pattern follows the migration of the ITCZ, with associated locations of maximum rainfall being depicted fairly well by the ensemble model. For the study area, the ensemble mean results were found to simulate fairly well the annual rainfall cycle when compared to individual RCM models. In general, the study revealed some fairly good agreement between annual rainfall cycle simulated by ensemble of CORDEX RCMs and the CHIRPS data. The most notable shortcoming in most individual RCMs is the early peak and overestimation of the mean monthly rainfall particularly in the Deyr season (Figure 1(a)). Studies have shown that GCMs tend to overestimate rainfall in the Horn of Africa region during October to December season [2] [44] . IPCC reports have indicated limitation in the extent of skilful rainfall projection due to the nonlinear and chaotic nature of the climate system [2] . Results from the study showed that the ensemble models closely reproduced realistic representation of the observed climate features. Figure 1(b) shows the performance of CORDEX RCMs in simulating the mean surface temperature over Jubaland compared to the observed temperature data. The ensemble model seems to overestimate temperature when compared to the observed data during the hot months of Jan-April while underestimate during July to December, Figure 1(b). The results from the study indicated that the multi-model ensembles outperformed the individual RCM model as shown in Figure 2(a) and Figure 2(b). All of the RCMs however captured fairly well the rainfall seasonality in Lower Jubba, though significant biases can be found in individual models depending on the seasons as seen in Figure 2(a). The model bias for precipitation in each individual model varies from month to month. NOAA, CNRM and MPI and overestimated the rainfall data between August and November while MIROC underestimates the rainfall data in the same period. Figure 2(b) also showed variation in performance of the RCMs from month to month even with the temperature data. ICHEC underestimated the temperatures between January and June, while NOAA underestimated the data between July and December. MOCH and NCC overestimated the data in April. Similar results are from some previous studies for the Multi-model ensemble projections [2] [34] [35] [36] . It observed from the examination of the skill of the individual CORDEX models and ensemble models simulation observed CHIRPS and GEOCLIM data over the period 1961-1990 best during Gu (AMJ) season. Thus projection of future rainfall scenarios was undertaken for only the Gu (AMJ) season. The projections undertaken for temperature were observed for all seasons. It observed from the examination of the skill of the individual CORDEX models and ensemble models simulation observed CHIRPS and GEOCLIM data over the period 1961-1990 best during Gu (AMJ) season. Thus projection of future rainfall scenarios was undertaken for only the Gu (AMJ) season. The projections undertaken for temperature were observed for all seasons. The results for future projections of rainfall and temperature with the CORDEX RCMs are given below for IPCC sub periods of 2030, 2050 and 2070. The simulations of rainfall concentrated on the Gu (April-June) season, where most models showed more realistic simulations of rainfall. The geographical distribution exhibits notable spatial variability in rainfall over Lower Jubba. Badhaadhe district towards the southern coast exhibits the highest amount of rainfall as seen in Table 1. The southern costal region shows the highest projected amount of rainfall in Lower Jubba throughout all three sub-periods as was seen with the historical data published [20] . The patterns of the projected changes in seasonal ensemble mean Gu rainfall for the three sub-periods namely 2030, 2050 and 2070 showed significant variations in the magnitude of the projected seasonal rainfall from place to place, season, sub-periods and scenarios. There is a general increase in rainfall in Lower Jubba from 2030 to 2070. The projected rainfall is however not homogeneous throughout the region with the inland region receiving the least amount of rainfall. Similar results are reported in the Somali NAPA which shows an increase in rainfall in 2050 and 2080 [45] . This is also supported by IPCC studies that project an increase in MAM rainfall in 2050-2100 in most parts of Eastern Africa [2] . North eastern Kenya bordering Lower Jubba is projected to receive an increase in rainfall of 40% relative to the baseline period (1981-2010) by 2100 during its long rain season [46] . Table 1 shows the range of seasonal precipitation from the projected ensemble data for Gu, averaged over the districts in Jubaland, with RCP4.5 scenario for the three sub-periods 2030, 2050 and 2070. The observed trends of the temporal evolution of the projected precipitation over this region are shown in Figures 3(a)-(c). The results show a decreasing trend for the first sub-period Figure 3(a), followed by an increasing trend for the second and third sub-periods Figure 3(b) and Figure 3(c). The trends are however not statistically significant at a 95% confidence level. Despite being statistically insignificant the results are similar to those of studies over the region [1] [2] [47] . For Africa, IPCC projects that almost all countries except South Africa will probably experience a significant reduction in precipitation until 2050 which then increases significantly between 2050 and 2100 [2] corroborating the results displayed in Figures 3(a)-(c). The averaged mean water vapor, evaporation and precipitation are projected to increase globally by 2100 [1] [2] . The use of climate change knowledge, particularly when mainstreamed into planned policies and poverty reduction strategies can provide a starting point for the identification of climate risks at a district, regional and national level. The projected rainfall further shows dominant dry and wet phases of the Gu season in the future (Figure 4), which calls for sustained investment in early warning mechanisms, and water management systems. The spatial representation of the projected rainfall trends showed no homogenous patterns throughout the three study sub periods. While some areas in Lower Jubba are projected to have general decrease in rainfall during the long rain season, other areas were projected to have a general increase in rainfall (Table 2). General increasing trend was however seen throughout Lower Jubba, with different magnitude of the changes. Details of the pattern in the trend in each district can be seen in Table 2. Although the projected rainfall trends were still not statistically significant, the complexity of the observed characteristics of the changes continues to call for further studies and tailored mitigation and adaptation strategies over the region of study. Individual rainfall time series shown in Figure 5 further indicate general dominance of depressed rainfall during the sub period ending in 2030, followed with dominance of positive rainfall anomalies during the last two sub-periods ending in 2050 and 2070. These results signify the need for investment in early warning mechanisms in Lower Jubba. Results on Lower Jubba are similar to projected results for Africa, where the impacts of climate change will be exacerbated by widespread poverty, diseases and high population growth rates, which would intensify the demand for food, water and livestock [47] [48] . The projected recurrence of depressed rainfall for the near future is significant for a country that is already highly vulnerable with high poverty levels across multiple dimensions [49] . Somalia is already experiencing food insecurity, the implication of a further risk to food and water security could pause a threat on security in a struggle for available resources. Furthermore, results from this study have shown that communities in Lower Jubba revert to charcoal production when their livelihoods are threatened, the impact of which is forest degradation. The recurrence of extreme below normal rainfall often associated with drought is also evident, given the communities use of charcoal as an adaptation strategy, an increase in deforestation and degradation can be expected. The projected precipitation presented in this study call for urgency in finding short and mid-term solutions. The increase in above average rainfall associated with floods as seen in Figure 4 by in sub-period 2 (2050) is also consistent with Tierney, et al. and IPCC that projects increased precipitation in Africa generally during the same period [1] [2] [47] . The magnitude of the extreme above and below average rainfall for the projected future is not the same as seen in Figure 4. Similar results in the bordering regions in Kenya, project an increase in intensity of rainfall, and extreme rainfall events [46] . The spatial pattern of the projected seasonal ensemble mean surface temperature based on the RCMs are shown for the three sub-periods namely 2030, 2050 and 2070 relative to the baseline period showed general warming at most locations over the three sub periods ending in 2030, 2050 and 2070. Results however show that projected change in temperature will vary from season to season and district to district. Like the observed GISTEMP data [20], the average temperature seems to increase towards the southern costal band in all seasons, possibly due to influence by Indian Ocean [50] . The ensemble models however seemed to overestimate the temperature in JJA which according to the observed data [20] should register the lowest temperature. Results from the temperature time series (Figure 6) show an increasing temperatures in both the near to long term future. This is in line with global and regional reports that project an increase in the average temperature by 2030 and a further increase by 2050 [2] [24] [25] [44] [51] . Results are statistically significant at 95% confidence level. Changes in temperature and humidity are reportedly linked to increased vector borne diseases and helminthes infections [52] . This will also have far reaching implications on many socio-economic sectors. Figure 5 shows the anomalies in the projected temperature time series. Results are similar to IPCC [2] reports projecting more hot and fewer cold temperature extremes in most places as global mean temperatures increase in a seasonal time scale. Results showed the rate of increase in temperature by 0.3 to 0.7 degrees by 2035. The unique patterns of the temperature time series is the tendencies for the annual temperature extremes to be generally higher that the preceding years. WMO recent observations have shown such tendencies in the recent years for the annual mean temperature time series. In general, the projections for Lower Jubba indicated an increase in minimum and maximum temperatures in all seasons in the projection periods 2030, 2050 and 2070. Temperature projections are critical in the development of effective and realistic climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction strategies. The impact of an increasing temperature would be far reaching for most socio-economic sectors including community safety, water, food, energy, infrastructure, among others [26] [53] [54] . The projected temperature would also exacerbate health issues with heat related morbidity and mortality in Africa being projected to increase [26] [27] [53] [54] [55] . Studies have also projected that the geographical distribution of disease prone areas like Malaria will increase as climatic conditions change, creating more conducive conditions for new diseases to breed in areas that were previously disease free [53] [55] [56] [57] . Projected rainfall change patterns indicated significant increase in high rainfall extremes were exhibited in periods leading up to 2050 and 2070. In the case of temperature, the projections from all the models showed increase in minimum and maximum temperatures in all seasons and sub periods, like being observed temperature projection over other parts of the world. Most of livelihoods and the socio-economic activities in Somalia are dependent on water availability from rainfall. The 2030, 2050 and 2070 projected rainfall and temperature change scenarios show that Somalia future development and livelihoods in future will face increased threats of climate extremes unless effective climate smart adaptation systems form integral components of national development strategies. With the prolonging socio economic stability in the country, the development of the required community based effective climate smart adaptation systems will require support from global and regional partners. Efforts to achieve food security in Somalia have long been hampered by climate extremes such as floods and drought, as well as civil wars, political volatility, rapid population growth, among other miseries [4] [23] [58] [59] . Most of the socio-economic activities in Lower Jubba are rain dependent. Recurring drought and floods cause acute stress on a developing economy such as that of Lower Jubba. Flooding in Lower Jubba has been linked to RVF outbreaks which in the past has resulted in a ban in the export of livestock from Somalia and led to massive losses for communities and the Somali economy [60] [61] [62] . Rainfall variability, particularly the projected recurrence of below average extremes in the near future would also impact the rate of restoration of disturbed vegetation. Temperature anomalies indicate recurrences of positive anomalies within all the three projected periods except for OND where some negative anomalies were evident during the first projection period. Seasonal differences, in the observed temperature projections, were quite evident and are major issues that require more studies in order to develop effective and realistic climate change and disaster risk reduction strategies. Long term adaptation planning by the Jubaland Administration for Lower Jubba must take an integrated approach to both floods and drought for both the near, mid and far future. Investment in early warning systems for daily, monthly, seasonal and inter-annual prediction is critical for any effective adaptation strategy. Timely seasonal forecasts and drought monitoring is essential for drought risk reduction in Lower Jubba where livelihoods are closely intertwined with climate variability. The study further provides some important knowledge on rainfall variability and change over the Lower Jubba region that would contribute to the 6th IPCC assessment report on the state of regional climate change over Africa. The knowledge on the past, present and future rainfall patterns derived from this study is important in the development of any effective disaster risk reduction and climate change strategies of Somalia in supporting sustainable development goals, implementation of the Paris UNFCCC, Sendai disaster risk reduction, among other global, regional, national and community based resilience building frameworks.', 'summary': 'Keywords:  Increasing evidence is able to link climate change to major and minor threats to natural systems, threatening environmental, social and economic development [1] [2] . Climate change impacts are projected to slow down economic growth, making poverty reduction even more difficult, while prolonging existing poverty traps [2] . Increase in temperature could also change the ecology of infectious diseases as well as increase temperature related mortality and morbidity of people and livestock [2] [26] [27] . Climate Change projections for Somalia will be used to derive information regarding the potential increase of the threats of climate extremes on future development and livelihoods. Data from the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) Africa framework was used in this study to project scenarios for precipitation in Lower Jubba. At the same time the analysis showed significant biases in individual models depending on sub-region and season; however, the ensemble mean had better agreement with observation than individual models. The analysis concluded that the multi-model ensemble mean simulates eastern Africa rainfall adequately and could therefore be used for the assessment of future climate projections for the region. The CORDEX RCMs data was obtained from IGAD Climate Prediction and Application Centre (ICPAC) which is the WMO regional climate center for the Greater Horn of Africa. The ensemble model data was used in this study to compute the correlation value r and linear trend lines for each pixel for the individual seasons. The results from model verification and climate change projections with CORDEX RCA4.5 models are independently highlighted in the following sections. Results from the study showed that the ensemble models closely reproduced realistic representation of the observed climate features. Temperature projections are critical in the development of effective and realistic climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction strategies. With the prolonging socio economic stability in the country, the development of the required community based effective climate smart adaptation systems will require support from global and regional partners.'}, {'authors': {'Manyu Chang': 'https://www.scirp.org/journal/articles.aspx?searchCode=Manyu+Chang&searchField=authors&page=1&SKID=0', 'Claudine Dereczynski': 'https://www.scirp.org/journal/articles.aspx?searchCode=Claudine+Dereczynski&searchField=authors&page=1&SKID=0', 'Marcos A.

Positive tendencies in the frequency of occurrence and duration of heat waves, as well as in the amount of rain associated with extreme events are observed in more areas than negative trends. Unfortunately such results are of medium confidence due to insufficient data and studies in the region. For North America, Central America, Europe and Mediterranean results are more conclusive and show with high confidence the unequivocal warming. According to the IPCC, the air temperature at the surface (ocean and continent) measured globally increased by 0.85Ë\x9aC over the period 1880-2012. In this paper, some of the indicators of climatic extremes presented by the IPCC are used to compose the proposed Climate Change Index (CCI) whose objective is to indicate the degree of future susceptibility to cli- matic extremes in a given region. The CCI, along with other indices of biophysical susceptibility and socioeconomic vulnerability is used to comprise the synthesized Vulnerability Index (VI) for climatic extremes [2] . The VI seeks to identify vulnerabilities to climatic extremes of different dimensions that make certain regions sus- ceptible to the impacts of climate change, with possible future exacerbations beyond what is happening at present. The methodology used to construct the CCI reflects in a great extend the methodology used in the report â\x80\x9cMap of the Vulnerability of the People of the State of Rio de Janeiro to the Impacts of Climate Change upon Social, Health and Environmental Areasâ\x80\x9d authored by FIOCRUZ and SEA-RJ 2011 [3] . In this report mean values of air temperature and precipitation are used. The present research opted for five indicators of climatic extremes as opposed to averages, since studies have shown an amplification of extremes in recent decades, despite the fact that climatological mean values have suffered little change [4] . Moreover, changes in extremes, as pointed out by the [1] , have a much bigger impact on society and ecosystems in general than the increase in average values [5] -[7] . The proposed methodology is applied to the state of Paraná, which was initiated by the study on the detection of climate change, considering indicators of climatic extremes from observational data from the Agronomic In- stitute of Paraná [8] . The methodology and data used to calculate the CCI are given in Section 2; the results of applying the methodology to the state of Paraná are presented in Section 3; and the conclusions in Section 4. The meteorological data for the calculation of indicators of climatic extremes used to construct the CCI are ob- tained from simulations from the Eta regional model with horizontal resolution of 40 km by 40 km. The regional Eta model [9] was nested inside the HadCM3 global coupled model [10] . This downscaling of global model si- mulations of the HadCM3 Eta model for South America will be called Eta-HadCM3. For present climate condi- tions (1961-1990) the CO2 concentration was considered to be 330 ppm, and for the future (2041-2070) climate, the emission scenario from the A1B Special Report on Emission Scenarios was used-SRES [11] . Four integra- tions were made with the Eta-HadCM3, generated from perturbations of the physics of the HadCM3 model. Among these four runs two were used in this study, one member (or scenario) which showed the highest climate sensitivity at the end of the century, to be referred to here as â\x80\x9chighâ\x80\x9d, and another member which had the lowest climate sensitivity, to be called â\x80\x9clowâ\x80\x9d. The climate sensitivity is based on the change in global temperature. The use of these two runs was an attempt to span the possible variations that the HadCM3 model produced in its global simulations. According to [12] , although the four runs all correspond to the A1B emission scenario, the projections of temperature increase resulting from each of the runs show similarities to increases characteristic of scenarios of low (B1) and high emission (A2 or A1FI). Reference [13] evaluated the simulations of the Eta-HadCM3 model for South America and showed good agreement between the simulations of the present climate and the observational data, suggesting adequacy of the model for studies of climate change in South America. Reference [12] evaluated the climate projections of the Eta-HadCM3 model for South America for the future climate. The projections indicate a strong warming (between 4Ë\x9aC and 6Ë\x9aC) on the South American continent and strong reductions of rainfall in Amazonia and Northeast Brazil (reaching up to 40% compared to the present). All model projections point to more intense changes after 2041, indicating a drier and warmer climate in the ba- sins of the Amazon, São Francisco and Paraná rivers, with small changes in precipitation for the last of these. The variables used for the calculation of indicators of climatic extremesâ\x80\x94air temperature every 6 hours and daily precipitationâ\x80\x94are extracted from each of the 216 gridpoints of the Eta-HadCM3 model simulations over Paraná, with each point covering 40 × 40 km2 of the territory of this state, as shown in Figure 1. For each model grid point, the indicators of climatic extremes are calculated for air temperature and precipita- tion from the present climate (1961-1990) and the future climate (2041-2070), for the â\x80\x9chighâ\x80\x9d and â\x80\x9clowâ\x80\x9d mem- bers. The choice of a future period at an intermediate distance between 2011 and 2099 is due to the fact that, a future that is too distant, such as 2100, makes things more difficult for political decision-makers trying to grasp such a time span. In the present research, five indicators of climatic extremes were selected from among those developed by the Expert Team on Climate Change Detection Monitoring and Indices (ETCCDMI), established by the Commis- sion for Climatology of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and by the CLIVAR Climate Variabil- ity and Predictability Program to make viable a global analysis of climate extremes. The five indicators of climatic extremes used in this research are: annual rainfall totals for rainy days, i.e., days when rainfall is greater than or equal to 1 mm (PRCPTOT, in mm); total annual rainfall on days when rain- fall is greater than that of the 95th percentile of the rainy days (R95p, in mm); maximum number of consecutive dry days for the year, that is, the days on which rainfall is less than 1 mm (CDD, in days) and annual mean maxi- mum (TMAXmean) and minimum (TMINmean) temperatures, in degrees Celsius. These indicators are gener- ated with the aid of the RClimdex program [14] , formulated in Canada and designed specifically to calculate climatic extremes. The term â\x80\x9cclimatic anomalyâ\x80\x9d as used in this study is the absolute difference of the changes projected by the model for the future climate relative to its current climate. The outputs of the program RClimdex provide an annual value for each of the five indicators analyzed. Initially obtained for each grid point are the average values of the present (1961-1990) and future (2041-2070) period for PRCPTOT, R95p, CDD, TMAXmean and TMIN mean. Next we compute the â\x80\x9canomaliesâ\x80\x9d as shown in Equation (1), obtaining the value of APRCPTOT, AR95p, ACDD, and ATMAXmean and ATMINmean at each grid point in the model. where AEXT represents the anomaly of the indicator of a climatic extreme and the bar represents the mean val- ue of EXT in the period considered. In addition to calculating climatic anomalies as described in Equation (1), we proceeded to normalize them, i.e., the â\x80\x9cclimatic anomaliesâ\x80\x9d were also divided by their respective standard deviations (Equation (2)) calculated from the present climate. The â\x80\x9cnormalized climatic anomalyâ\x80\x9d (Equation (3)) reflects more effectively the impact of future climate change in relation to the present climate. In other words, the degree of stress due to a future climate change depends on the variability experienced in the present climate. This interpretation of â\x80\x9cstandard climatic anomalyâ\x80\x9d leads to the inference that the greater the present variability (standard deviation), the less the effect of stress felt due to future variation, because it is expected that populations and ecosystems would al- ready be accustomed to the variability in a given phenomenon, and therefore are already adapted to it. where is the total number of years, EXT are the values of the indicators of climatic extremes (PRCPTOT, R95p, CDD, TMAXmean and TMINmean) for each year, DPEXT is the standard deviation of the indicator of climatic extreme and is the normalized anomaly of the indicator of the climatic extreme. Despite the advantages of standardization as described above, the analyses related purely to â\x80\x9cclimatic anoma- liesâ\x80\x9d (without normalization) are maintained here in order to stress the absolute magnitude of the changes pro- jected for the future (2041-2070) in relation to the present (1961-1990) for air temperature and precipitation. After the calculation of the â\x80\x9cnormalized climatic anomaliesâ\x80\x9d for each indicator of an extreme at each grid point in the state of Paraná, these are divided into classes. The division into classes considers the lowest and highest value of the â\x80\x9cnormalized anomaliesâ\x80\x9d of the five indicators of extremes obtained at all model grid points for each of the two members, â\x80\x9chighâ\x80\x9d and â\x80\x9clowâ\x80\x9d. For each of the classes a score is assigned ranging from 0 to 1, with a score of 0 attributed to the smallest and 1 to the largest with respect to the standard deviation. In order to obtain the indicators of normalized climatic extremes for each of the 399 municipalities in the state of Paraná, the Grid Analyst ArcGIS 10.1 program was used, with the aid of the Extract Value Grid with Polygon command. The polygon in this case is the geographic representation of each municipality that is superimposed on the contours resulting from the interpolation of the grid data. This process of â\x80\x9cmunicipalizationâ\x80\x9d generates for each municipality in Paraná a normalized anomaly indicator for each of the five chosen parameters. The Climate Change Index (CCI) is represented by the highest score of the class of anomalies among the five indicators of climate extremes for the â\x80\x9chighâ\x80\x9d and â\x80\x9clowâ\x80\x9d members, as shown in Equation (4). This is achieved with the understanding that when one of the variables under analysis presents a significant climatic anomaly, be it temperature, precipitation or drought stress, this is sufficient to characterize the susceptibility to future climate change, so that the calculation of the average anomalies cannot mischaracterize the intensity of anomalies and underestimate important critical aspects. In this section the methodology proposed for the calculation of the CCI is presented for the state of Paraná. The results and maps obtained give indications of the anomalies of the climatic extremes in the state for the â\x80\x9chighâ\x80\x9d member, projected for the period 2041-2070. Initially, the distribution of the anomalies of the climatic extremes associated with precipitation and air temperature is analyzed. In Figures 2-4, the anomaly strips are shown for the indicators of climatic extremes of precipitation, which in- cludes APRCPTOT, AR95P and ACDD, for the â\x80\x9chighâ\x80\x9d member. It is noted on the maps of APRCPTOT and R95p a similar pattern of anomaly, with increased rainfall in almost the entire region studied, intensifying from north to south in the state. The total annual rainfall on wet days (PRCPTOT) projected from 2041 to 2070 (rela- tive to 1961-1990) shows an average increase ranging from 15 mm in the north to 466 mm in the south, includ- ing the coast. In regard to ACDD higher values can be seen, indicating dry periods that are longer in the north- east but fall off towards the southwest coast of the state. In the northeast of the state it is projected for 2041- 2070 an average increase of about 7 days in the duration of periods of consecutive dry days. For the extremes of temperature (ATMAXmean and ATMINmean), a projection of warming throughout the state is noted, with the largest increases of temperature in the northeast, approximately 4Ë\x9aC in the â\x80\x9chighâ\x80\x9d mem ber, decreasing in the direction of the coast. This indicates that the present-day rate of increase of TMAXmean and TMINmean, which is statistically significant at +0.02Ë\x9aC/year [8] , will be intensified in the future. In order to facilitate the interpretation of the CCI, the predominant anomalies were grouped into three categories: 1) precipitation anomaly, grouping the anomalies of APRCPTOT and AR95p; 2) anomaly of hydrologicstress, which is the same as the anomaly ACDD; and 3) temperature anomaly, composed of the maximum (ATMAX- mean) and minimum (ATMINmean) temperature anomalies. Table 1 shows the average for each indicator of extreme climate throughout the state of Paraná from its nor- malized anomalies. We note that with the normalization of extreme weather anomalies projected for 2041-2070, the prevailing anomaly happens to be, for the most part, related to extremes of temperature, with the minimum temperature () having the greatest influence. The temperature anomaly (and) in the municipalities was significantly larger than all the weather extremes analyzed. For the â\x80\x9chighâ\x80\x9d scenario the projected ATMINmean is 6.79 times larger than its standard deviation in the present climate, while all the mean precipitation anomalies, whether in the â\x80\x9chighâ\x80\x9d or â\x80\x9clowâ\x80\x9d scenario, had values below 1, indicating impacts of little relevance. In other words, the expected future precipitation variability is current already. The distribution of the number of municipalities in Paraná in each score class is shown in Table 2, where it can be seen that even in the â\x80\x9clowâ\x80\x9d scenario the scores are greater than 0.4 and in the â\x80\x9chighâ\x80\x9d scenario 98% of the scores are concentrated between 0.8 and 1. The maps of the normalized anomalies of climatic extremes in the â\x80\x9chighâ\x80\x9d member are shown in Figure 5, ex- cept for and which were omitted because of no indications of large variations in their spatial patterns. values (figure not shown) are very high in almost the entire state, with scores in the class 0.8 - 1.0, except only around the municipality of Telêmaco Borba in the Serra do Cadeado, where the class is slightly lower, between 0.6 and 0.8. Regarding (Figure 6), most of the municipalities show strong anomalies (scoring at 0.6 to 0.8), with a group of 16 municipalities in the far Central-South region showing very strong anomalies (score at 0.8 to 1). With regard to the three indicators analyzed that characterize extremes precipitation, , and, all are low or moderately low in most part of the state. shows a group of municipalities with moderately low index, between 0.2 and 0.4, located in the Southeastern region and some municipalities in the far Southwest of the state (see Figure 7). AR95p showed low intensity (score 0 to 0.2). As for this also showed a group of municipalities with moderately low index in the class from 0.2 to 0.4, also located in the Eastern region of the state, excluding the municipalities at the coast at the Serra do Mar (Fig- ure 8). Superposing the maps of (Figure 8) and (Figure 7) it can be observed that there is a subgroup of 47 municipalities in the south/southeast that is prominent in changing the distribution of preci- pitation, showing an increase in PRCPTOT as well as in CDD, albeit with moderately low intensity (Figure 9). In other words, these municipalities will experience a major shift in the distribution of rainfall, with greatest to- tal annual rainfall and longer dry periods in the future (Figure 9). The municipalities have values of APRCPTOT between 0.4 and 0.6 and ACDD between 0.2 and 0.4. Table 3 groups the municipalities by class of scores of standardized climatic extremes. It appears that in general, the effects of anomalies related to rain (, , and) are of little importance in most municipalities, concentrated as they are in the lowest class of scores (i.e., 0 to 0.2) of low intensity. This is due to the fact that the projected magnitude of the anomaly of precipitation extremes fits within the respective standard deviation of the precipitation extreme of the present climate. Table 3 shows that the greatest susceptibility to future climate change will most likely fall on the minimum temperature, with 394 municipalities (99%) having a very intense anomaly (in the â\x80\x9chighâ\x80\x9d member) with maximum score between 0.8 and 1, corresponding to an increase in the minimum temperature of 6 to 8 times the present-day standard deviation of minimum temperature. The second largest anomaly is very likely to be the maximum temperature (also in the high member) where 16 municipalities have a very intense anomaly, with maximum score from 0.8 to 1 and 374 municipalities (94%) characterized as intense, with a relatively high score, between 0.6 and 0.8, which corresponds to a maximum temperature increase of 5 to 6 times the standard deviation of maximum temperature experienced at present. It should be emphasized that it was established in the methodology of the CCI that if the municipality exhibits only one of the indicators of elevated climatic anomaly, this is sufficient to characterize it as susceptible to a fu- ture climatic anomaly. Consequently, it is concluded that virtually all municipalities in the state will be suscepti- ble to climate change due to their susceptibility to anomalies of maximum and minimum temperatures prevailing in the case of high sensitivity to emissions of greenhouse gases from the A1B scenario. The Climatic Change Index (CCI) is calculated for each municipality, where the analysis of the five climate ex- treme indicators jointly makes apparent the profile of the intensity of the projected anomalies. Figure 10 below is an example of a â\x80\x9cradarâ\x80\x9d chart analysis for the municipality of União da Vitória as an illustration of this kind of visualization. The municipality of União da Vitória is situated in the Central South of the State and, as already mentioned, is part of the group of municipalities with high (moderately low, score = 0.26, while at the same time there is an increase in ACDD, also moderately low in the â\x80\x9chighâ\x80\x9d scenario (â\x80\x9chighâ\x80\x9d, score = 0.21). However, what stands out most for the municipality is the high intensity of the impact of the temperature ano- maly in the â\x80\x9chighâ\x80\x9d member. União da Vitória is one of the municipalities of the group most impacted in the high member with CCI â\x80\x9chighâ\x80\x9d above 0.85 and CCI â\x80\x9clowâ\x80\x9d equal to 0.63. In the â\x80\x9chighâ\x80\x9d member, the impact appears very intense for both the minimum temperature (â\x80\x9chighâ\x80\x9d, score = 0.85) and for the maximum tempera- ture (â\x80\x9chighâ\x80\x9d, score = 0.81). The score â\x80\x9chighâ\x80\x9d of 0.85 represents an anomaly of about six times the standard deviation of the present-day minimum temperature. In this paper we propose the use of a Climate Change Index (CCI) to assess the degree of susceptibility of a re- gion to future climate extremes associated with the air temperature and precipitation. The advantage of this in- dex is the possibility of synthesizing various extreme climatic indicators into a single index in a standardized way. The methodology used to calculate the CCI is based on projections of indicators of climate extremes for a fu- ture period of two climatic scenarios (low and high emission) normalized in relation to their values in the pre- sent climate. The indicators of climatic extremes used are: total annual precipitation for days with rain, i.e., days when rainfall is equal to or greater than 1 mm (PRCPTOT, in mm); total annual rainfall on the days when rainfall is greater than the 95th percentile of the rainy days (R95p, in mm); maximum number of consecutive dry days in the year, or days in which precipitation is less than 1 mm (CDD, in days); and annual averages of maximum (TMAXmean) and minimum (TMINmean) temperatures, in degrees Celsius. The methodology was applied to the state of Paraná from regionalized Eta-HadCM3 projections for the present (1961-1990) and future (2041-2070). The results show an alleged increase in PRCPTOT for the period 2041-2070 as compared to the period 1961-1990, referred as the present climate by the RCM, that is projected to range from 25 mm in the northern part of the state to 465 mm in the south. Likewise, R95p will also increase in the future, following the same spa- tial pattern as PRCPTOT. On the other hand, an increase in CDD is projected, which means longer dry periods. This shows that if the projections prove accurate, then in the decades of 2041-2070 rainfall will be poorly dis- tributed, with stronger and/or more frequent intense rainfall events and longer dry periods. Analysis of the CCI makes clear that differences of projected extreme rainfall (total rainfall, heavy rain and water stress) are insignificant in view of the differences of projected extreme temperatures, since the change in future precipitation falls within the range of present variability. Conversely, the differences of projected extreme temperatures (both minimum and maximum) are likely to range between 2 to 7 times greater than the present variations. In terms of comparison between the two members, the indicators of climatic extremes in the â\x80\x9chighâ\x80\x9d member are in general stronger than those in the â\x80\x9clowâ\x80\x9d member, with a larger number of municipalities with increased vulnerability in the â\x80\x9chighâ\x80\x9d member, in the A1B emission scenario. In terms of location of climate vulnerability within the state, practically all of the state in the â\x80\x9chighâ\x80\x9d member, is found to be in the class with the highest score (CCI > 0.8), which means very intense susceptibility, due to the increase projected in minimum temperatures. These inferences, although preliminary, give indications of the need for preventive actions necessary over the medium and long term, by municipal and state authorities, such as the adaptation of crops, infrastructure, build- ings, and changing of practices and behaviors to cope with projected climatic anomalies. Large strides are being made in the improvement of global and regional models, with increasing accurate re- sults for mapping climate sensitivity and vulnerability. Likewise, in methodological terms, the indicators of climatic extremes selected for the calculation of the CCI can be adjusted to better represent future climate sensitivities to be faced in different states.', 'summary': 'The term â\x80\x9cclimatic anomalyâ\x80\x9d as used in this study is the absolute difference of the changes projected by the model for the future climate relative to its current climate. The â\x80\x9cnormalized climatic anomalyâ\x80\x9d (Equation (3)) reflects more effectively the impact of future climate change in relation to the present climate. In other words, the degree of stress due to a future climate change depends on the variability experienced in the present climate.

In Sub-Saharan Africa, vulnerability to climate change for local communities is increased because of their dependence on rain fed agriculture     . Large populations in Somalia in particular have experienced severer impacts due to water stress as their livelihoods are dependent on access to water and pasture   . 94% of nomadic populations in Somalia are reportedly living in poverty. Somaliaâ\x80\x99s long coastal line provides fishing livelihood systems threatened by unique marine systems that include Somalia ocean currents systems, tropical cyclones and before tropical cyclones. Somalia has seen an increase in frequency and intensity of floods and droughts with severe droughts in 2007/2008, 2011/2012, 2015/16/17  . Climate induced displacement in Somalia continues to increase with UN listing the number of internally displaced persons due to drought between November 2016 and October 2017 at 943,000  . Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (2015-2030) recognized the difficulty in achieving sustainable development without the development of climate smart systems. Climate change impacts are projected to slow down economic growth, making poverty reduction even more difficult, while prolonging existing poverty traps  . Climate change risks undermine the sustainability of basic livelihoods, threatening food security, health among other socio-economic impacts. Without proper adaptation measures, the projected increase in frequency and severity of weather and climate extremes will undermine the safety of ecosystems and health      . The need to strengthen Somaliaâ\x80\x99s capacity to deal with disasters, such as the protracted droughts and floods that it continues to face, is critical  . The study attempted to provide projected rainfall and temperature change scenarios for Lower Jubba region, Somalia. This was done using the downscaled Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) RCMs data. The annual rainfall and temperature cycles simulated by an ensemble of CORDEX RCMs were compared with the observed data. The analysis focused on the Gu long rain season, which had the best agreement in comparison to the observed rainfall data. Projections for temperature were done for all the standard global climatological seasons namely northern hemisphere summer, winter, autumn and spring seasons that correspond to June to August, December to February, September to November, March to May months. The projections of the future Gu long rain season characteristics was done using the IPCC projected periods of 2030, 2050 and 2070 benchmarks. Lower Jubba is located in the Jubaland state of Somalia   . Jubaland consists of the Gedo, Lower Jubba and Middle Jubba regions, and lies 40 - 60 km east of the Jubba River, stretching from Gedo to the Indian Ocean. The state of Jubaland borders the Garrisa, Wajir and Mandera County of Kenya on the western side. Kismayo, located in Lower Jubba, is the largest city in Jubaland, and the third largest city in Somalia after Mogadishu and Hargesa  . Lower Jubba receives about 350 mm rainfall during Gu (AMJ) season and an average of 250 mm Deyr (SON) season. Lower Jubba saw a general decreasing trend in rainfall during the Gu rainfall season, and a general increasing trend in the Deyr rainfall between 1981 to 2015  . The Lower Jubba region has also experienced an increase in occurrence of depressed rainfall usually associated with drought, and a decrease in the frequency of above normal rainfall associated with floods  . Studies on the GHA show a decrease of MAM long rains and increase in the OND short rains    . Lower Jubba has seen increasing trends in the minimum, maximum and average temperature , consistent with the results from many recent studies worldwide    . Increase in temperature could also change the ecology of infectious diseases as well as increase temperature related mortality and morbidity of people and livestock    . Climate Change projections for Somalia will be used to derive information regarding the potential increase of the threats of climate extremes on future development and livelihoods. It will also enable the development of effective climate smart adaptation strategies. Details of area of study, data used and methodologies adopted are highlighted in the following sections. Gridded CHIRPS and GeoCLIM observations for the period 1960-90 were used as the baseline observations data. CHIRPS is a global dataset (50Ë\x9aS - 50Ë\x9aN, 180Ë\x9aE - 180Ë\x9aW), 0.05Ë\x9a resolution, 1981 to near-present gridded precipitation time series. CHIRPS data are produced by scientists at the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) Climate Hazard Group (CHG) and the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Earth Resources Observation and Science (EROS) Center. The data was developed to support the United States Agency for International Development Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET). Rainfall Measuring Mission Multi-satellite Precipitation Analysis version 7 (TMPA 3B42 v7) is used to calibrate global Cold Cloud Duration (CCD) rainfall estimates. Details on CHIRPS data and their usability in the region are well documented by ICPAC among many others   . A coordinated set of the 20th and 21st century climate simulations for the Atmosphere Ocean coupled Global Climate Models (AOGCMs) in the Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5) have been contributed to by climate modelling groups from all around the world  . Data from the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) Africa framework was used in this study to project scenarios for precipitation in Lower Jubba. The CORDEX program is an initiative by World Climate Research Program (WCRP) of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) that generates high-resolution climate projections (50 km) for climate studies, within the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) timeline and beyond    . CORDEX data used in this study represented precipitation fairly well over the region and thus can be used to inform on adaptation and mitigation strategies      . These climate models describe the coupling of the atmosphere with the land surface, with differing dynamics and physics formulations   . For each experiment the historical runs, forced by observed natural and anthropogenic atmospheric composition, cover the period from 1950-2005. The future projections (2006-2100) are forced with two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP), namely; RCP4.5 (mid-range emissions) and RCP8.5 (high-end emissions) scenarios, which prescribe future atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations and aerosols. Detail on the CORDEX RCMs can be found in Endris  and Nikulin  . Endris  evaluated the ability of the CORDEX RCMs in simulating the general characteristics of the climate over Eastern Africa region by analyzing the annual cycle, spatial variability, pattern correlation and root mean square error using a Taylor diagram. The study found that these RCMs reasonably simulate the main features of the rainfall climatology over eastern Africa and also reproduce the majority of the documented regional responses to ENSO and IOD forcings. At the same time the analysis showed significant biases in individual models depending on sub-region and season; however, the ensemble mean had better agreement with observation than individual models. The analysis concluded that the multi-model ensemble mean simulates eastern Africa rainfall adequately and could therefore be used for the assessment of future climate projections for the region. The CORDEX RCMs data was obtained from IGAD Climate Prediction and Application Centre (ICPAC) which is the WMO regional climate center for the Greater Horn of Africa. In this study the region of interest was Lower Jubba that is bounded by latitudes 1.5Ë\x9aS - 12.0Ë\x9aN and longitudes 41.0Ë\x9aE - 51.0Ë\x9aE. There IPCC based climate projection reference period were used namely 2030 (sub-period 1), sub-period up to 2050 (sub-period 2), and sub-period up to 2070 (sub-period 3). The study was divided into two major sections namely assessment of Model Skill in Simulating Observed Climate during the period 1961-1990, and the projection of future rainfall and temperature scenarios. Standard methods were adopted to determine the best climate model/s that could be used for the projection of future climate change scenarios for Lower Jubba region of Somalia for the two standard rainfall seasons Gu (April to June) and Deyr (September to November). The temperature simulations were for all standard seasons of the year in Somalia namely December-February (DJF), March-May (MAM), July-August (JJA), and September-November (SON). Standard methods were also adopted to test the spatial and temporal bias of the individual models. The methods used included various time series methods, correlation and regression analysis. Correlation methods examined correlations between the observed and simulated outputs at specific grid point locations. The square of the correlation coefficient is knows as coefficient of determination (r2) which represented the variance of the observed data that could be accounted for by the predicted variable. Regression method attempted to fit the best linear mathematical equation for the observed relationships. The statistical significance of the fitted linear regression trends were examined using graphical approaches as well as the standards statistical test that include the use of Mann-Kendall Rank Statistics. Similar methods have been adopted in many studies in Africa and the world at large        . A linear regression trend was investigated by examining the relationship between time (T) and the variable of interest (X), in this case rainfall, using the following equation X(t) is the individual observed seasonal rainfall/temperature during the baseline period 1960-1990, while Y(t) are corresponding values simulated by the individual CORDEX models over the period 1961-1990, c and b are normally the intercept and gradient (slope) of the regression equation. The slope indicates the average rate of change in the dependent variable in each year of the given time period. A positive/negative slope shows an increasing/decreasing trend respectively. The limitation of this method is that it assumes that all linkages between observed and CORDEX models generated models are linear, and the distributions of the observed and predicted records are normal. For non-normal data the study included nonparametric tests namely the Mann-Kendall rank statistics method was used. In the Mann-Kendall analysis data is ranked after being placed in time sequential order. The time series values (X1, X2, X3, X4 â\x80¦, Xn) where X in this case represents rainfall are replaced by their relative ranks (R1, R2, R3, R4 â\x80¦, Rn) (starting from the lowest value up to n). The relative magnitudes of sample data is compared rather than the data values themselves    . The equation used is as follows, where S is the Kendall score given a dataset R with a sample size of n values. The Kendall statistics s is given in Equation (2) below based on Kendall, 1938; 1945; 1948 The observed trend is significant if s values in Equation (2) have significance levels equal or less than 0.5. The ensemble model data was used in this study to compute the correlation value r and linear trend lines for each pixel for the individual seasons. The results for both correlation coefficient r value and the slope were mapped for each pixel and season. The results from the assessment of Model Skill in Simulating Observed Climate for the various seasons determined the models and seasons that were projected into the future using CORDEX RCA4.5 models. The three sub-periods used in the projections included the sub-periods up to 2030 (sub-period 1), up to 2050 (sub-period 2), and up to 2070 (sub-period 3). The results from model verification and climate change projections with CORDEX RCA4.5 models are independently highlighted in the following sections. The annual cycle of Gu (AMJ) and Deyr (SON) season rainfall for the baseline period 1960-90 from gridded CHIRPS observations and CORDEX RCMs simulated outputs were compared the study area in order to determine the best ensemble models that can be used for the future climate change rainfall projections. Future projections of temperature were undertaken for all the four standard seasons of the year. Figure 1(a) and Figure 1(b) illustrate the performance of CORDEX RCMs in simulating annual rainfall and temperature cycles over the study area as compared to the CHIRPS data. All of the RCMs capture fairly well the rainfall seasonality in Lower Jubba. Figure 1(a) shows that the north-south rainfall pattern follows the migration of the ITCZ, with associated locations of maximum rainfall being depicted fairly well by the ensemble model. For the study area, the ensemble mean results were found to simulate fairly well the annual rainfall cycle when compared to individual RCM models. In general, the study revealed some fairly good agreement between annual rainfall cycle simulated by ensemble of CORDEX RCMs and the CHIRPS data. The most notable shortcoming in most individual RCMs is the early peak and overestimation of the mean monthly rainfall particularly in the Deyr season (Figure 1(a)). Studies have shown that GCMs tend to overestimate rainfall in the Horn of Africa region during October to December season   . IPCC reports have indicated limitation in the extent of skilful rainfall projection due to the nonlinear and chaotic nature of the climate system  . Results from the study showed that the ensemble models closely reproduced realistic representation of the observed climate features. Figure 1(b) shows the performance of CORDEX RCMs in simulating the mean surface temperature over Jubaland compared to the observed temperature data. The ensemble model seems to overestimate temperature when compared to the observed data during the hot months of Jan-April while underestimate during July to December, Figure 1(b). The results from the study indicated that the multi-model ensembles outperformed the individual RCM model as shown in Figure 2(a) and Figure 2(b). All of the RCMs however captured fairly well the rainfall seasonality in Lower Jubba, though significant biases can be found in individual models depending on the seasons as seen in Figure 2(a). The model bias for precipitation in each individual model varies from month to month. NOAA, CNRM and MPI and overestimated the rainfall data between August and November while MIROC underestimates the rainfall data in the same period. Figure 2(b) also showed variation in performance of the RCMs from month to month even with the temperature data. ICHEC underestimated the temperatures between January and June, while NOAA underestimated the data between July and December. MOCH and NCC overestimated the data in April. Similar results are from some previous studies for the Multi-model ensemble projections     . It observed from the examination of the skill of the individual CORDEX models and ensemble models simulation observed CHIRPS and GEOCLIM data over the period 1961-1990 best during Gu (AMJ) season. Thus projection of future rainfall scenarios was undertaken for only the Gu (AMJ) season. The projections undertaken for temperature were observed for all seasons. It observed from the examination of the skill of the individual CORDEX models and ensemble models simulation observed CHIRPS and GEOCLIM data over the period 1961-1990 best during Gu (AMJ) season. Thus projection of future rainfall scenarios was undertaken for only the Gu (AMJ) season. The projections undertaken for temperature were observed for all seasons. The results for future projections of rainfall and temperature with the CORDEX RCMs are given below for IPCC sub periods of 2030, 2050 and 2070. The simulations of rainfall concentrated on the Gu (April-June) season, where most models showed more realistic simulations of rainfall. The geographical distribution exhibits notable spatial variability in rainfall over Lower Jubba. Badhaadhe district towards the southern coast exhibits the highest amount of rainfall as seen in Table 1. The southern costal region shows the highest projected amount of rainfall in Lower Jubba throughout all three sub-periods as was seen with the historical data published  . The patterns of the projected changes in seasonal ensemble mean Gu rainfall for the three sub-periods namely 2030, 2050 and 2070 showed significant variations in the magnitude of the projected seasonal rainfall from place to place, season, sub-periods and scenarios. There is a general increase in rainfall in Lower Jubba from 2030 to 2070. The projected rainfall is however not homogeneous throughout the region with the inland region receiving the least amount of rainfall. Similar results are reported in the Somali NAPA which shows an increase in rainfall in 2050 and 2080  . This is also supported by IPCC studies that project an increase in MAM rainfall in 2050-2100 in most parts of Eastern Africa  . North eastern Kenya bordering Lower Jubba is projected to receive an increase in rainfall of 40% relative to the baseline period (1981-2010) by 2100 during its long rain season  . Table 1 shows the range of seasonal precipitation from the projected ensemble data for Gu, averaged over the districts in Jubaland, with RCP4.5 scenario for the three sub-periods 2030, 2050 and 2070. The observed trends of the temporal evolution of the projected precipitation over this region are shown in Figures 3(a)-(c). The results show a decreasing trend for the first sub-period Figure 3(a), followed by an increasing trend for the second and third sub-periods Figure 3(b) and Figure 3(c). The trends are however not statistically significant at a 95% confidence level. Despite being statistically insignificant the results are similar to those of studies over the region    . For Africa, IPCC projects that almost all countries except South Africa will probably experience a significant reduction in precipitation until 2050 which then increases significantly between 2050 and 2100  corroborating the results displayed in Figures 3(a)-(c). The averaged mean water vapor, evaporation and precipitation are projected to increase globally by 2100   . The use of climate change knowledge, particularly when mainstreamed into planned policies and poverty reduction strategies can provide a starting point for the identification of climate risks at a district, regional and national level. The projected rainfall further shows dominant dry and wet phases of the Gu season in the future (Figure 4), which calls for sustained investment in early warning mechanisms, and water management systems. The spatial representation of the projected rainfall trends showed no homogenous patterns throughout the three study sub periods. While some areas in Lower Jubba are projected to have general decrease in rainfall during the long rain season, other areas were projected to have a general increase in rainfall (Table 2). General increasing trend was however seen throughout Lower Jubba, with different magnitude of the changes. Details of the pattern in the trend in each district can be seen in Table 2. Although the projected rainfall trends were still not statistically significant, the complexity of the observed characteristics of the changes continues to call for further studies and tailored mitigation and adaptation strategies over the region of study. Individual rainfall time series shown in Figure 5 further indicate general dominance of depressed rainfall during the sub period ending in 2030, followed with dominance of positive rainfall anomalies during the last two sub-periods ending in 2050 and 2070. These results signify the need for investment in early warning mechanisms in Lower Jubba. Results on Lower Jubba are similar to projected results for Africa, where the impacts of climate change will be exacerbated by widespread poverty, diseases and high population growth rates, which would intensify the demand for food, water and livestock   . The projected recurrence of depressed rainfall for the near future is significant for a country that is already highly vulnerable with high poverty levels across multiple dimensions  . Somalia is already experiencing food insecurity, the implication of a further risk to food and water security could pause a threat on security in a struggle for available resources. Furthermore, results from this study have shown that communities in Lower Jubba revert to charcoal production when their livelihoods are threatened, the impact of which is forest degradation. The recurrence of extreme below normal rainfall often associated with drought is also evident, given the communities use of charcoal as an adaptation strategy, an increase in deforestation and degradation can be expected. The projected precipitation presented in this study call for urgency in finding short and mid-term solutions. The increase in above average rainfall associated with floods as seen in Figure 4 by in sub-period 2 (2050) is also consistent with Tierney, et al. and IPCC that projects increased precipitation in Africa generally during the same period    . The magnitude of the extreme above and below average rainfall for the projected future is not the same as seen in Figure 4. Similar results in the bordering regions in Kenya, project an increase in intensity of rainfall, and extreme rainfall events  . The spatial pattern of the projected seasonal ensemble mean surface temperature based on the RCMs are shown for the three sub-periods namely 2030, 2050 and 2070 relative to the baseline period showed general warming at most locations over the three sub periods ending in 2030, 2050 and 2070. Results however show that projected change in temperature will vary from season to season and district to district. Like the observed GISTEMP data , the average temperature seems to increase towards the southern costal band in all seasons, possibly due to influence by Indian Ocean  . The ensemble models however seemed to overestimate the temperature in JJA which according to the observed data  should register the lowest temperature. Results from the temperature time series (Figure 6) show an increasing temperatures in both the near to long term future. This is in line with global and regional reports that project an increase in the average temperature by 2030 and a further increase by 2050      . Results are statistically significant at 95% confidence level. Changes in temperature and humidity are reportedly linked to increased vector borne diseases and helminthes infections  . This will also have far reaching implications on many socio-economic sectors. Figure 5 shows the anomalies in the projected temperature time series. Results are similar to IPCC  reports projecting more hot and fewer cold temperature extremes in most places as global mean temperatures increase in a seasonal time scale. Results showed the rate of increase in temperature by 0.3 to 0.7 degrees by 2035. The unique patterns of the temperature time series is the tendencies for the annual temperature extremes to be generally higher that the preceding years. WMO recent observations have shown such tendencies in the recent years for the annual mean temperature time series. In general, the projections for Lower Jubba indicated an increase in minimum and maximum temperatures in all seasons in the projection periods 2030, 2050 and 2070. Temperature projections are critical in the development of effective and realistic climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction strategies. The impact of an increasing temperature would be far reaching for most socio-economic sectors including community safety, water, food, energy, infrastructure, among others    . The projected temperature would also exacerbate health issues with heat related morbidity and mortality in Africa being projected to increase      . Studies have also projected that the geographical distribution of disease prone areas like Malaria will increase as climatic conditions change, creating more conducive conditions for new diseases to breed in areas that were previously disease free     . Projected rainfall change patterns indicated significant increase in high rainfall extremes were exhibited in periods leading up to 2050 and 2070. In the case of temperature, the projections from all the models showed increase in minimum and maximum temperatures in all seasons and sub periods, like being observed temperature projection over other parts of the world. Most of livelihoods and the socio-economic activities in Somalia are dependent on water availability from rainfall. The 2030, 2050 and 2070 projected rainfall and temperature change scenarios show that Somalia future development and livelihoods in future will face increased threats of climate extremes unless effective climate smart adaptation systems form integral components of national development strategies. With the prolonging socio economic stability in the country, the development of the required community based effective climate smart adaptation systems will require support from global and regional partners. Efforts to achieve food security in Somalia have long been hampered by climate extremes such as floods and drought, as well as civil wars, political volatility, rapid population growth, among other miseries     . Most of the socio-economic activities in Lower Jubba are rain dependent. Recurring drought and floods cause acute stress on a developing economy such as that of Lower Jubba. Flooding in Lower Jubba has been linked to RVF outbreaks which in the past has resulted in a ban in the export of livestock from Somalia and led to massive losses for communities and the Somali economy    . Rainfall variability, particularly the projected recurrence of below average extremes in the near future would also impact the rate of restoration of disturbed vegetation. Temperature anomalies indicate recurrences of positive anomalies within all the three projected periods except for OND where some negative anomalies were evident during the first projection period. Seasonal differences, in the observed temperature projections, were quite evident and are major issues that require more studies in order to develop effective and realistic climate change and disaster risk reduction strategies. Long term adaptation planning by the Jubaland Administration for Lower Jubba must take an integrated approach to both floods and drought for both the near, mid and far future. Investment in early warning systems for daily, monthly, seasonal and inter-annual prediction is critical for any effective adaptation strategy. Timely seasonal forecasts and drought monitoring is essential for drought risk reduction in Lower Jubba where livelihoods are closely intertwined with climate variability. The study further provides some important knowledge on rainfall variability and change over the Lower Jubba region that would contribute to the 6th IPCC assessment report on the state of regional climate change over Africa. The knowledge on the past, present and future rainfall patterns derived from this study is important in the development of any effective disaster risk reduction and climate change strategies of Somalia in supporting sustainable development goals, implementation of the Paris UNFCCC, Sendai disaster risk reduction, among other global, regional, national and community based resilience building frameworks.', 'summary': 'Keywords:  Increasing evidence is able to link climate change to major and minor threats to natural systems, threatening environmental, social and economic development   .

CHIRPS is a global dataset (50Ë\x9aS - 50Ë\x9aN, 180Ë\x9aE - 180Ë\x9aW), 0.05Ë\x9a resolution, 1981 to near-present gridded precipitation time series. CHIRPS data are produced by scientists at the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) Climate Hazard Group (CHG) and the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Earth Resources Observation and Science (EROS) Center. The data was developed to support the United States Agency for International Development Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET). Rainfall Measuring Mission Multi-satellite Precipitation Analysis version 7 (TMPA 3B42 v7) is used to calibrate global Cold Cloud Duration (CCD) rainfall estimates. Details on CHIRPS data and their usability in the region are well documented by ICPAC among many others . A coordinated set of the 20th and 21st century climate simulations for the Atmosphere Ocean coupled Global Climate Models (AOGCMs) in the Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5) have been contributed to by climate modelling groups from all around the world . Data from the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) Africa framework was used in this study to project scenarios for precipitation in Lower Jubba. The CORDEX program is an initiative by World Climate Research Program (WCRP) of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) that generates high-resolution climate projections (50 km) for climate studies, within the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) timeline and beyond . CORDEX data used in this study represented precipitation fairly well over the region and thus can be used to inform on adaptation and mitigation strategies . These climate models describe the coupling of the atmosphere with the land surface, with differing dynamics and physics formulations . For each experiment the historical runs, forced by observed natural and anthropogenic atmospheric composition, cover the period from 1950-2005. The future projections (2006-2100) are forced with two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP), namely; RCP4.5 (mid-range emissions) and RCP8.5 (high-end emissions) scenarios, which prescribe future atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations and aerosols. Detail on the CORDEX RCMs can be found in Endris and Nikulin . Endris evaluated the ability of the CORDEX RCMs in simulating the general characteristics of the climate over Eastern Africa region by analyzing the annual cycle, spatial variability, pattern correlation and root mean square error using a Taylor diagram. The study found that these RCMs reasonably simulate the main features of the rainfall climatology over eastern Africa and also reproduce the majority of the documented regional responses to ENSO and IOD forcings. At the same time the analysis showed significant biases in individual models depending on sub-region and season; however, the ensemble mean had better agreement with observation than individual models. The analysis concluded that the multi-model ensemble mean simulates eastern Africa rainfall adequately and could therefore be used for the assessment of future climate projections for the region. The CORDEX RCMs data was obtained from IGAD Climate Prediction and Application Centre (ICPAC) which is the WMO regional climate center for the Greater Horn of Africa. In this study the region of interest was Lower Jubba that is bounded by latitudes 1.5Ë\x9aS - 12.0Ë\x9aN and longitudes 41.0Ë\x9aE - 51.0Ë\x9aE. There IPCC based climate projection reference period were used namely 2030 (sub-period 1), sub-period up to 2050 (sub-period 2), and sub-period up to 2070 (sub-period 3). The study was divided into two major sections namely assessment of Model Skill in Simulating Observed Climate during the period 1961-1990, and the projection of future rainfall and temperature scenarios. Standard methods were adopted to determine the best climate model/s that could be used for the projection of future climate change scenarios for Lower Jubba region of Somalia for the two standard rainfall seasons Gu (April to June) and Deyr (September to November). The temperature simulations were for all standard seasons of the year in Somalia namely December-February (DJF), March-May (MAM), July-August (JJA), and September-November (SON). Standard methods were also adopted to test the spatial and temporal bias of the individual models. The methods used included various time series methods, correlation and regression analysis. Correlation methods examined correlations between the observed and simulated outputs at specific grid point locations. The square of the correlation coefficient is knows as coefficient of determination (r2) which represented the variance of the observed data that could be accounted for by the predicted variable. Regression method attempted to fit the best linear mathematical equation for the observed relationships. The statistical significance of the fitted linear regression trends were examined using graphical approaches as well as the standards statistical test that include the use of Mann-Kendall Rank Statistics. Similar methods have been adopted in many studies in Africa and the world at large . A linear regression trend was investigated by examining the relationship between time (T) and the variable of interest (X), in this case rainfall, using the following equation X(t) is the individual observed seasonal rainfall/temperature during the baseline period 1960-1990, while Y(t) are corresponding values simulated by the individual CORDEX models over the period 1961-1990, c and b are normally the intercept and gradient (slope) of the regression equation. The slope indicates the average rate of change in the dependent variable in each year of the given time period. A positive/negative slope shows an increasing/decreasing trend respectively. The limitation of this method is that it assumes that all linkages between observed and CORDEX models generated models are linear, and the distributions of the observed and predicted records are normal. For non-normal data the study included nonparametric tests namely the Mann-Kendall rank statistics method was used. In the Mann-Kendall analysis data is ranked after being placed in time sequential order. The time series values (X1, X2, X3, X4 â\x80¦, Xn) where X in this case represents rainfall are replaced by their relative ranks (R1, R2, R3, R4 â\x80¦, Rn) (starting from the lowest value up to n). The relative magnitudes of sample data is compared rather than the data values themselves . The equation used is as follows, where S is the Kendall score given a dataset R with a sample size of n values. The Kendall statistics s is given in Equation (2) below based on Kendall, 1938; 1945; 1948 The observed trend is significant if s values in Equation (2) have significance levels equal or less than 0.5. The ensemble model data was used in this study to compute the correlation value r and linear trend lines for each pixel for the individual seasons. The results for both correlation coefficient r value and the slope were mapped for each pixel and season. The results from the assessment of Model Skill in Simulating Observed Climate for the various seasons determined the models and seasons that were projected into the future using CORDEX RCA4.5 models. The three sub-periods used in the projections included the sub-periods up to 2030 (sub-period 1), up to 2050 (sub-period 2), and up to 2070 (sub-period 3). The results from model verification and climate change projections with CORDEX RCA4.5 models are independently highlighted in the following sections. The annual cycle of Gu (AMJ) and Deyr (SON) season rainfall for the baseline period 1960-90 from gridded CHIRPS observations and CORDEX RCMs simulated outputs were compared the study area in order to determine the best ensemble models that can be used for the future climate change rainfall projections. Future projections of temperature were undertaken for all the four standard seasons of the year. Figure 1(a) and Figure 1(b) illustrate the performance of CORDEX RCMs in simulating annual rainfall and temperature cycles over the study area as compared to the CHIRPS data. All of the RCMs capture fairly well the rainfall seasonality in Lower Jubba. Figure 1(a) shows that the north-south rainfall pattern follows the migration of the ITCZ, with associated locations of maximum rainfall being depicted fairly well by the ensemble model. For the study area, the ensemble mean results were found to simulate fairly well the annual rainfall cycle when compared to individual RCM models. In general, the study revealed some fairly good agreement between annual rainfall cycle simulated by ensemble of CORDEX RCMs and the CHIRPS data. The most notable shortcoming in most individual RCMs is the early peak and overestimation of the mean monthly rainfall particularly in the Deyr season (Figure 1(a)). Studies have shown that GCMs tend to overestimate rainfall in the Horn of Africa region during October to December season . IPCC reports have indicated limitation in the extent of skilful rainfall projection due to the nonlinear and chaotic nature of the climate system . Results from the study showed that the ensemble models closely reproduced realistic representation of the observed climate features. Figure 1(b) shows the performance of CORDEX RCMs in simulating the mean surface temperature over Jubaland compared to the observed temperature data. The ensemble model seems to overestimate temperature when compared to the observed data during the hot months of Jan-April while underestimate during July to December, Figure 1(b). The results from the study indicated that the multi-model ensembles outperformed the individual RCM model as shown in Figure 2(a) and Figure 2(b). All of the RCMs however captured fairly well the rainfall seasonality in Lower Jubba, though significant biases can be found in individual models depending on the seasons as seen in Figure 2(a). The model bias for precipitation in each individual model varies from month to month. NOAA, CNRM and MPI and overestimated the rainfall data between August and November while MIROC underestimates the rainfall data in the same period. Figure 2(b) also showed variation in performance of the RCMs from month to month even with the temperature data. ICHEC underestimated the temperatures between January and June, while NOAA underestimated the data between July and December. MOCH and NCC overestimated the data in April. Similar results are from some previous studies for the Multi-model ensemble projections . It observed from the examination of the skill of the individual CORDEX models and ensemble models simulation observed CHIRPS and GEOCLIM data over the period 1961-1990 best during Gu (AMJ) season. Thus projection of future rainfall scenarios was undertaken for only the Gu (AMJ) season. The projections undertaken for temperature were observed for all seasons. It observed from the examination of the skill of the individual CORDEX models and ensemble models simulation observed CHIRPS and GEOCLIM data over the period 1961-1990 best during Gu (AMJ) season. Thus projection of future rainfall scenarios was undertaken for only the Gu (AMJ) season. The projections undertaken for temperature were observed for all seasons. The results for future projections of rainfall and temperature with the CORDEX RCMs are given below for IPCC sub periods of 2030, 2050 and 2070. The simulations of rainfall concentrated on the Gu (April-June) season, where most models showed more realistic simulations of rainfall. The geographical distribution exhibits notable spatial variability in rainfall over Lower Jubba. Badhaadhe district towards the southern coast exhibits the highest amount of rainfall as seen in Table 1. The southern costal region shows the highest projected amount of rainfall in Lower Jubba throughout all three sub-periods as was seen with the historical data published . The patterns of the projected changes in seasonal ensemble mean Gu rainfall for the three sub-periods namely 2030, 2050 and 2070 showed significant variations in the magnitude of the projected seasonal rainfall from place to place, season, sub-periods and scenarios. There is a general increase in rainfall in Lower Jubba from 2030 to 2070. The projected rainfall is however not homogeneous throughout the region with the inland region receiving the least amount of rainfall. Similar results are reported in the Somali NAPA which shows an increase in rainfall in 2050 and 2080 . This is also supported by IPCC studies that project an increase in MAM rainfall in 2050-2100 in most parts of Eastern Africa . North eastern Kenya bordering Lower Jubba is projected to receive an increase in rainfall of 40% relative to the baseline period (1981-2010) by 2100 during its long rain season . Table 1 shows the range of seasonal precipitation from the projected ensemble data for Gu, averaged over the districts in Jubaland, with RCP4.5 scenario for the three sub-periods 2030, 2050 and 2070. The observed trends of the temporal evolution of the projected precipitation over this region are shown in Figures 3(a)-(c). The results show a decreasing trend for the first sub-period Figure 3(a), followed by an increasing trend for the second and third sub-periods Figure 3(b) and Figure 3(c). The trends are however not statistically significant at a 95% confidence level. Despite being statistically insignificant the results are similar to those of studies over the region . For Africa, IPCC projects that almost all countries except South Africa will probably experience a significant reduction in precipitation until 2050 which then increases significantly between 2050 and 2100 corroborating the results displayed in Figures 3(a)-(c). The averaged mean water vapor, evaporation and precipitation are projected to increase globally by 2100 . The use of climate change knowledge, particularly when mainstreamed into planned policies and poverty reduction strategies can provide a starting point for the identification of climate risks at a district, regional and national level. The projected rainfall further shows dominant dry and wet phases of the Gu season in the future (Figure 4), which calls for sustained investment in early warning mechanisms, and water management systems. The spatial representation of the projected rainfall trends showed no homogenous patterns throughout the three study sub periods. While some areas in Lower Jubba are projected to have general decrease in rainfall during the long rain season, other areas were projected to have a general increase in rainfall (Table 2). General increasing trend was however seen throughout Lower Jubba, with different magnitude of the changes. Details of the pattern in the trend in each district can be seen in Table 2. Although the projected rainfall trends were still not statistically significant, the complexity of the observed characteristics of the changes continues to call for further studies and tailored mitigation and adaptation strategies over the region of study. Individual rainfall time series shown in Figure 5 further indicate general dominance of depressed rainfall during the sub period ending in 2030, followed with dominance of positive rainfall anomalies during the last two sub-periods ending in 2050 and 2070. These results signify the need for investment in early warning mechanisms in Lower Jubba. Results on Lower Jubba are similar to projected results for Africa, where the impacts of climate change will be exacerbated by widespread poverty, diseases and high population growth rates, which would intensify the demand for food, water and livestock . The projected recurrence of depressed rainfall for the near future is significant for a country that is already highly vulnerable with high poverty levels across multiple dimensions . Somalia is already experiencing food insecurity, the implication of a further risk to food and water security could pause a threat on security in a struggle for available resources. Furthermore, results from this study have shown that communities in Lower Jubba revert to charcoal production when their livelihoods are threatened, the impact of which is forest degradation. The recurrence of extreme below normal rainfall often associated with drought is also evident, given the communities use of charcoal as an adaptation strategy, an increase in deforestation and degradation can be expected. The projected precipitation presented in this study call for urgency in finding short and mid-term solutions. The increase in above average rainfall associated with floods as seen in Figure 4 by in sub-period 2 (2050) is also consistent with Tierney, et al. and IPCC that projects increased precipitation in Africa generally during the same period . The magnitude of the extreme above and below average rainfall for the projected future is not the same as seen in Figure 4. Similar results in the bordering regions in Kenya, project an increase in intensity of rainfall, and extreme rainfall events . The spatial pattern of the projected seasonal ensemble mean surface temperature based on the RCMs are shown for the three sub-periods namely 2030, 2050 and 2070 relative to the baseline period showed general warming at most locations over the three sub periods ending in 2030, 2050 and 2070. Results however show that projected change in temperature will vary from season to season and district to district. Like the observed GISTEMP data, the average temperature seems to increase towards the southern costal band in all seasons, possibly due to influence by Indian Ocean . The ensemble models however seemed to overestimate the temperature in JJA which according to the observed data should register the lowest temperature. Results from the temperature time series (Figure 6) show an increasing temperatures in both the near to long term future. This is in line with global and regional reports that project an increase in the average temperature by 2030 and a further increase by 2050 . Results are statistically significant at 95% confidence level. Changes in temperature and humidity are reportedly linked to increased vector borne diseases and helminthes infections . This will also have far reaching implications on many socio-economic sectors. Figure 5 shows the anomalies in the projected temperature time series. Results are similar to IPCC reports projecting more hot and fewer cold temperature extremes in most places as global mean temperatures increase in a seasonal time scale. Results showed the rate of increase in temperature by 0.3 to 0.7 degrees by 2035. The unique patterns of the temperature time series is the tendencies for the annual temperature extremes to be generally higher that the preceding years. WMO recent observations have shown such tendencies in the recent years for the annual mean temperature time series. In general, the projections for Lower Jubba indicated an increase in minimum and maximum temperatures in all seasons in the projection periods 2030, 2050 and 2070. Temperature projections are critical in the development of effective and realistic climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction strategies. The impact of an increasing temperature would be far reaching for most socio-economic sectors including community safety, water, food, energy, infrastructure, among others . The projected temperature would also exacerbate health issues with heat related morbidity and mortality in Africa being projected to increase . Studies have also projected that the geographical distribution of disease prone areas like Malaria will increase as climatic conditions change, creating more conducive conditions for new diseases to breed in areas that were previously disease free . Projected rainfall change patterns indicated significant increase in high rainfall extremes were exhibited in periods leading up to 2050 and 2070. In the case of temperature, the projections from all the models showed increase in minimum and maximum temperatures in all seasons and sub periods, like being observed temperature projection over other parts of the world. Most of livelihoods and the socio-economic activities in Somalia are dependent on water availability from rainfall. The 2030, 2050 and 2070 projected rainfall and temperature change scenarios show that Somalia future development and livelihoods in future will face increased threats of climate extremes unless effective climate smart adaptation systems form integral components of national development strategies. With the prolonging socio economic stability in the country, the development of the required community based effective climate smart adaptation systems will require support from global and regional partners. Efforts to achieve food security in Somalia have long been hampered by climate extremes such as floods and drought, as well as civil wars, political volatility, rapid population growth, among other miseries . Most of the socio-economic activities in Lower Jubba are rain dependent. Recurring drought and floods cause acute stress on a developing economy such as that of Lower Jubba. Flooding in Lower Jubba has been linked to RVF outbreaks which in the past has resulted in a ban in the export of livestock from Somalia and led to massive losses for communities and the Somali economy . Rainfall variability, particularly the projected recurrence of below average extremes in the near future would also impact the rate of restoration of disturbed vegetation. Temperature anomalies indicate recurrences of positive anomalies within all the three projected periods except for OND where some negative anomalies were evident during the first projection period. Seasonal differences, in the observed temperature projections, were quite evident and are major issues that require more studies in order to develop effective and realistic climate change and disaster risk reduction strategies. Long term adaptation planning by the Jubaland Administration for Lower Jubba must take an integrated approach to both floods and drought for both the near, mid and far future. Investment in early warning systems for daily, monthly, seasonal and inter-annual prediction is critical for any effective adaptation strategy. Timely seasonal forecasts and drought monitoring is essential for drought risk reduction in Lower Jubba where livelihoods are closely intertwined with climate variability. The study further provides some important knowledge on rainfall variability and change over the Lower Jubba region that would contribute to the 6th IPCC assessment report on the state of regional climate change over Africa. The knowledge on the past, present and future rainfall patterns derived from this study is important in the development of any effective disaster risk reduction and climate change strategies of Somalia in supporting sustainable development goals, implementation of the Paris UNFCCC, Sendai disaster risk reduction, among other global, regional, national and community based resilience building frameworks.', 'summary': 'Keywords:  Increasing evidence is able to link climate change to major and minor threats to natural systems, threatening environmental, social and economic development .

In Sub-Saharan Africa, vulnerability to climate change for local communities is increased because of their dependence on rain fed agriculture . Large populations in Somalia in particular have experienced severer impacts due to water stress as their livelihoods are dependent on access to water and pasture . 94% of nomadic populations in Somalia are reportedly living in poverty. Somaliaâ\x80\x99s long coastal line provides fishing livelihood systems threatened by unique marine systems that include Somalia ocean currents systems, tropical cyclones and before tropical cyclones. Somalia has seen an increase in frequency and intensity of floods and droughts with severe droughts in 2007/2008, 2011/2012, 2015/16/17 . Climate induced displacement in Somalia continues to increase with UN listing the number of internally displaced persons due to drought between November 2016 and October 2017 at 943,000 . Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (2015-2030) recognized the difficulty in achieving sustainable development without the development of climate smart systems. Climate change impacts are projected to slow down economic growth, making poverty reduction even more difficult, while prolonging existing poverty traps . Climate change risks undermine the sustainability of basic livelihoods, threatening food security, health among other socio-economic impacts. Without proper adaptation measures, the projected increase in frequency and severity of weather and climate extremes will undermine the safety of ecosystems and health . The need to strengthen Somaliaâ\x80\x99s capacity to deal with disasters, such as the protracted droughts and floods that it continues to face, is critical . The study attempted to provide projected rainfall and temperature change scenarios for Lower Jubba region, Somalia. This was done using the downscaled Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) RCMs data. The annual rainfall and temperature cycles simulated by an ensemble of CORDEX RCMs were compared with the observed data. The analysis focused on the Gu long rain season, which had the best agreement in comparison to the observed rainfall data. Projections for temperature were done for all the standard global climatological seasons namely northern hemisphere summer, winter, autumn and spring seasons that correspond to June to August, December to February, September to November, March to May months. The projections of the future Gu long rain season characteristics was done using the IPCC projected periods of 2030, 2050 and 2070 benchmarks. Lower Jubba is located in the Jubaland state of Somalia . Jubaland consists of the Gedo, Lower Jubba and Middle Jubba regions, and lies 40 - 60 km east of the Jubba River, stretching from Gedo to the Indian Ocean. The state of Jubaland borders the Garrisa, Wajir and Mandera County of Kenya on the western side. Kismayo, located in Lower Jubba, is the largest city in Jubaland, and the third largest city in Somalia after Mogadishu and Hargesa . Lower Jubba receives about 350 mm rainfall during Gu (AMJ) season and an average of 250 mm Deyr (SON) season. Lower Jubba saw a general decreasing trend in rainfall during the Gu rainfall season, and a general increasing trend in the Deyr rainfall between 1981 to 2015 . The Lower Jubba region has also experienced an increase in occurrence of depressed rainfall usually associated with drought, and a decrease in the frequency of above normal rainfall associated with floods . Studies on the GHA show a decrease of MAM long rains and increase in the OND short rains . Lower Jubba has seen increasing trends in the minimum, maximum and average temperature, consistent with the results from many recent studies worldwide . Increase in temperature could also change the ecology of infectious diseases as well as increase temperature related mortality and morbidity of people and livestock . Climate Change projections for Somalia will be used to derive information regarding the potential increase of the threats of climate extremes on future development and livelihoods. It will also enable the development of effective climate smart adaptation strategies. Details of area of study, data used and methodologies adopted are highlighted in the following sections. Gridded CHIRPS and GeoCLIM observations for the period 1960-90 were used as the baseline observations data. CHIRPS is a global dataset (50Ë\x9aS - 50Ë\x9aN, 180Ë\x9aE - 180Ë\x9aW), 0.05Ë\x9a resolution, 1981 to near-present gridded precipitation time series. CHIRPS data are produced by scientists at the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) Climate Hazard Group (CHG) and the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Earth Resources Observation and Science (EROS) Center. The data was developed to support the United States Agency for International Development Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET). Rainfall Measuring Mission Multi-satellite Precipitation Analysis version 7 (TMPA 3B42 v7) is used to calibrate global Cold Cloud Duration (CCD) rainfall estimates. Details on CHIRPS data and their usability in the region are well documented by ICPAC among many others . A coordinated set of the 20th and 21st century climate simulations for the Atmosphere Ocean coupled Global Climate Models (AOGCMs) in the Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5) have been contributed to by climate modelling groups from all around the world . Data from the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) Africa framework was used in this study to project scenarios for precipitation in Lower Jubba. The CORDEX program is an initiative by World Climate Research Program (WCRP) of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) that generates high-resolution climate projections (50 km) for climate studies, within the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) timeline and beyond . CORDEX data used in this study represented precipitation fairly well over the region and thus can be used to inform on adaptation and mitigation strategies . These climate models describe the coupling of the atmosphere with the land surface, with differing dynamics and physics formulations . For each experiment the historical runs, forced by observed natural and anthropogenic atmospheric composition, cover the period from 1950-2005. The future projections (2006-2100) are forced with two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP), namely; RCP4.5 (mid-range emissions) and RCP8.5 (high-end emissions) scenarios, which prescribe future atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations and aerosols. Detail on the CORDEX RCMs can be found in Endris and Nikulin . Endris evaluated the ability of the CORDEX RCMs in simulating the general characteristics of the climate over Eastern Africa region by analyzing the annual cycle, spatial variability, pattern correlation and root mean square error using a Taylor diagram. The study found that these RCMs reasonably simulate the main features of the rainfall climatology over eastern Africa and also reproduce the majority of the documented regional responses to ENSO and IOD forcings. At the same time the analysis showed significant biases in individual models depending on sub-region and season; however, the ensemble mean had better agreement with observation than individual models. The analysis concluded that the multi-model ensemble mean simulates eastern Africa rainfall adequately and could therefore be used for the assessment of future climate projections for the region. The CORDEX RCMs data was obtained from IGAD Climate Prediction and Application Centre (ICPAC) which is the WMO regional climate center for the Greater Horn of Africa. In this study the region of interest was Lower Jubba that is bounded by latitudes 1.5Ë\x9aS - 12.0Ë\x9aN and longitudes 41.0Ë\x9aE - 51.0Ë\x9aE. There IPCC based climate projection reference period were used namely 2030 (sub-period 1), sub-period up to 2050 (sub-period 2), and sub-period up to 2070 (sub-period 3). The study was divided into two major sections namely assessment of Model Skill in Simulating Observed Climate during the period 1961-1990, and the projection of future rainfall and temperature scenarios. Standard methods were adopted to determine the best climate model/s that could be used for the projection of future climate change scenarios for Lower Jubba region of Somalia for the two standard rainfall seasons Gu (April to June) and Deyr (September to November). The temperature simulations were for all standard seasons of the year in Somalia namely December-February (DJF), March-May (MAM), July-August (JJA), and September-November (SON). Standard methods were also adopted to test the spatial and temporal bias of the individual models. The methods used included various time series methods, correlation and regression analysis. Correlation methods examined correlations between the observed and simulated outputs at specific grid point locations. The square of the correlation coefficient is knows as coefficient of determination (r2) which represented the variance of the observed data that could be accounted for by the predicted variable. Regression method attempted to fit the best linear mathematical equation for the observed relationships. The statistical significance of the fitted linear regression trends were examined using graphical approaches as well as the standards statistical test that include the use of Mann-Kendall Rank Statistics. Similar methods have been adopted in many studies in Africa and the world at large . A linear regression trend was investigated by examining the relationship between time (T) and the variable of interest (X), in this case rainfall, using the following equation X(t) is the individual observed seasonal rainfall/temperature during the baseline period 1960-1990, while Y(t) are corresponding values simulated by the individual CORDEX models over the period 1961-1990, c and b are normally the intercept and gradient (slope) of the regression equation. The slope indicates the average rate of change in the dependent variable in each year of the given time period. A positive/negative slope shows an increasing/decreasing trend respectively. The limitation of this method is that it assumes that all linkages between observed and CORDEX models generated models are linear, and the distributions of the observed and predicted records are normal. For non-normal data the study included nonparametric tests namely the Mann-Kendall rank statistics method was used. In the Mann-Kendall analysis data is ranked after being placed in time sequential order. The time series values (X1, X2, X3, X4 â\x80¦, Xn) where X in this case represents rainfall are replaced by their relative ranks (R1, R2, R3, R4 â\x80¦, Rn) (starting from the lowest value up to n). The relative magnitudes of sample data is compared rather than the data values themselves . The equation used is as follows, where S is the Kendall score given a dataset R with a sample size of n values. The Kendall statistics s is given in Equation (2) below based on Kendall, 1938; 1945; 1948 The observed trend is significant if s values in Equation (2) have significance levels equal or less than 0.5. The ensemble model data was used in this study to compute the correlation value r and linear trend lines for each pixel for the individual seasons. The results for both correlation coefficient r value and the slope were mapped for each pixel and season. The results from the assessment of Model Skill in Simulating Observed Climate for the various seasons determined the models and seasons that were projected into the future using CORDEX RCA4.5 models. The three sub-periods used in the projections included the sub-periods up to 2030 (sub-period 1), up to 2050 (sub-period 2), and up to 2070 (sub-period 3). The results from model verification and climate change projections with CORDEX RCA4.5 models are independently highlighted in the following sections. The annual cycle of Gu (AMJ) and Deyr (SON) season rainfall for the baseline period 1960-90 from gridded CHIRPS observations and CORDEX RCMs simulated outputs were compared the study area in order to determine the best ensemble models that can be used for the future climate change rainfall projections. Future projections of temperature were undertaken for all the four standard seasons of the year. Figure 1(a) and Figure 1(b) illustrate the performance of CORDEX RCMs in simulating annual rainfall and temperature cycles over the study area as compared to the CHIRPS data. All of the RCMs capture fairly well the rainfall seasonality in Lower Jubba. Figure 1(a) shows that the north-south rainfall pattern follows the migration of the ITCZ, with associated locations of maximum rainfall being depicted fairly well by the ensemble model. For the study area, the ensemble mean results were found to simulate fairly well the annual rainfall cycle when compared to individual RCM models. In general, the study revealed some fairly good agreement between annual rainfall cycle simulated by ensemble of CORDEX RCMs and the CHIRPS data. The most notable shortcoming in most individual RCMs is the early peak and overestimation of the mean monthly rainfall particularly in the Deyr season (Figure 1(a)). Studies have shown that GCMs tend to overestimate rainfall in the Horn of Africa region during October to December season . IPCC reports have indicated limitation in the extent of skilful rainfall projection due to the nonlinear and chaotic nature of the climate system . Results from the study showed that the ensemble models closely reproduced realistic representation of the observed climate features. Figure 1(b) shows the performance of CORDEX RCMs in simulating the mean surface temperature over Jubaland compared to the observed temperature data. The ensemble model seems to overestimate temperature when compared to the observed data during the hot months of Jan-April while underestimate during July to December, Figure 1(b). The results from the study indicated that the multi-model ensembles outperformed the individual RCM model as shown in Figure 2(a) and Figure 2(b). All of the RCMs however captured fairly well the rainfall seasonality in Lower Jubba, though significant biases can be found in individual models depending on the seasons as seen in Figure 2(a). The model bias for precipitation in each individual model varies from month to month. NOAA, CNRM and MPI and overestimated the rainfall data between August and November while MIROC underestimates the rainfall data in the same period. Figure 2(b) also showed variation in performance of the RCMs from month to month even with the temperature data. ICHEC underestimated the temperatures between January and June, while NOAA underestimated the data between July and December. MOCH and NCC overestimated the data in April. Similar results are from some previous studies for the Multi-model ensemble projections . It observed from the examination of the skill of the individual CORDEX models and ensemble models simulation observed CHIRPS and GEOCLIM data over the period 1961-1990 best during Gu (AMJ) season. Thus projection of future rainfall scenarios was undertaken for only the Gu (AMJ) season. The projections undertaken for temperature were observed for all seasons. It observed from the examination of the skill of the individual CORDEX models and ensemble models simulation observed CHIRPS and GEOCLIM data over the period 1961-1990 best during Gu (AMJ) season. Thus projection of future rainfall scenarios was undertaken for only the Gu (AMJ) season. The projections undertaken for temperature were observed for all seasons. The results for future projections of rainfall and temperature with the CORDEX RCMs are given below for IPCC sub periods of 2030, 2050 and 2070. The simulations of rainfall concentrated on the Gu (April-June) season, where most models showed more realistic simulations of rainfall. The geographical distribution exhibits notable spatial variability in rainfall over Lower Jubba. Badhaadhe district towards the southern coast exhibits the highest amount of rainfall as seen in Table 1. The southern costal region shows the highest projected amount of rainfall in Lower Jubba throughout all three sub-periods as was seen with the historical data published . The patterns of the projected changes in seasonal ensemble mean Gu rainfall for the three sub-periods namely 2030, 2050 and 2070 showed significant variations in the magnitude of the projected seasonal rainfall from place to place, season, sub-periods and scenarios. There is a general increase in rainfall in Lower Jubba from 2030 to 2070. The projected rainfall is however not homogeneous throughout the region with the inland region receiving the least amount of rainfall. Similar results are reported in the Somali NAPA which shows an increase in rainfall in 2050 and 2080 . This is also supported by IPCC studies that project an increase in MAM rainfall in 2050-2100 in most parts of Eastern Africa . North eastern Kenya bordering Lower Jubba is projected to receive an increase in rainfall of 40% relative to the baseline period (1981-2010) by 2100 during its long rain season . Table 1 shows the range of seasonal precipitation from the projected ensemble data for Gu, averaged over the districts in Jubaland, with RCP4.5 scenario for the three sub-periods 2030, 2050 and 2070. The observed trends of the temporal evolution of the projected precipitation over this region are shown in Figures 3(a)-(c). The results show a decreasing trend for the first sub-period Figure 3(a), followed by an increasing trend for the second and third sub-periods Figure 3(b) and Figure 3(c). The trends are however not statistically significant at a 95% confidence level. Despite being statistically insignificant the results are similar to those of studies over the region . For Africa, IPCC projects that almost all countries except South Africa will probably experience a significant reduction in precipitation until 2050 which then increases significantly between 2050 and 2100 corroborating the results displayed in Figures 3(a)-(c). The averaged mean water vapor, evaporation and precipitation are projected to increase globally by 2100 . The use of climate change knowledge, particularly when mainstreamed into planned policies and poverty reduction strategies can provide a starting point for the identification of climate risks at a district, regional and national level. The projected rainfall further shows dominant dry and wet phases of the Gu season in the future (Figure 4), which calls for sustained investment in early warning mechanisms, and water management systems. The spatial representation of the projected rainfall trends showed no homogenous patterns throughout the three study sub periods. While some areas in Lower Jubba are projected to have general decrease in rainfall during the long rain season, other areas were projected to have a general increase in rainfall (Table 2). General increasing trend was however seen throughout Lower Jubba, with different magnitude of the changes. Details of the pattern in the trend in each district can be seen in Table 2. Although the projected rainfall trends were still not statistically significant, the complexity of the observed characteristics of the changes continues to call for further studies and tailored mitigation and adaptation strategies over the region of study. Individual rainfall time series shown in Figure 5 further indicate general dominance of depressed rainfall during the sub period ending in 2030, followed with dominance of positive rainfall anomalies during the last two sub-periods ending in 2050 and 2070. These results signify the need for investment in early warning mechanisms in Lower Jubba. Results on Lower Jubba are similar to projected results for Africa, where the impacts of climate change will be exacerbated by widespread poverty, diseases and high population growth rates, which would intensify the demand for food, water and livestock . The projected recurrence of depressed rainfall for the near future is significant for a country that is already highly vulnerable with high poverty levels across multiple dimensions . Somalia is already experiencing food insecurity, the implication of a further risk to food and water security could pause a threat on security in a struggle for available resources. Furthermore, results from this study have shown that communities in Lower Jubba revert to charcoal production when their livelihoods are threatened, the impact of which is forest degradation. The recurrence of extreme below normal rainfall often associated with drought is also evident, given the communities use of charcoal as an adaptation strategy, an increase in deforestation and degradation can be expected. The projected precipitation presented in this study call for urgency in finding short and mid-term solutions. The increase in above average rainfall associated with floods as seen in Figure 4 by in sub-period 2 (2050) is also consistent with Tierney, et al. and IPCC that projects increased precipitation in Africa generally during the same period . The magnitude of the extreme above and below average rainfall for the projected future is not the same as seen in Figure 4. Similar results in the bordering regions in Kenya, project an increase in intensity of rainfall, and extreme rainfall events . The spatial pattern of the projected seasonal ensemble mean surface temperature based on the RCMs are shown for the three sub-periods namely 2030, 2050 and 2070 relative to the baseline period showed general warming at most locations over the three sub periods ending in 2030, 2050 and 2070. Results however show that projected change in temperature will vary from season to season and district to district. Like the observed GISTEMP data, the average temperature seems to increase towards the southern costal band in all seasons, possibly due to influence by Indian Ocean . The ensemble models however seemed to overestimate the temperature in JJA which according to the observed data should register the lowest temperature. Results from the temperature time series (Figure 6) show an increasing temperatures in both the near to long term future. This is in line with global and regional reports that project an increase in the average temperature by 2030 and a further increase by 2050 . Results are statistically significant at 95% confidence level. Changes in temperature and humidity are reportedly linked to increased vector borne diseases and helminthes infections . This will also have far reaching implications on many socio-economic sectors. Figure 5 shows the anomalies in the projected temperature time series. Results are similar to IPCC reports projecting more hot and fewer cold temperature extremes in most places as global mean temperatures increase in a seasonal time scale. Results showed the rate of increase in temperature by 0.3 to 0.7 degrees by 2035. The unique patterns of the temperature time series is the tendencies for the annual temperature extremes to be generally higher that the preceding years. WMO recent observations have shown such tendencies in the recent years for the annual mean temperature time series. In general, the projections for Lower Jubba indicated an increase in minimum and maximum temperatures in all seasons in the projection periods 2030, 2050 and 2070. Temperature projections are critical in the development of effective and realistic climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction strategies. The impact of an increasing temperature would be far reaching for most socio-economic sectors including community safety, water, food, energy, infrastructure, among others . The projected temperature would also exacerbate health issues with heat related morbidity and mortality in Africa being projected to increase . Studies have also projected that the geographical distribution of disease prone areas like Malaria will increase as climatic conditions change, creating more conducive conditions for new diseases to breed in areas that were previously disease free . Projected rainfall change patterns indicated significant increase in high rainfall extremes were exhibited in periods leading up to 2050 and 2070. In the case of temperature, the projections from all the models showed increase in minimum and maximum temperatures in all seasons and sub periods, like being observed temperature projection over other parts of the world. Most of livelihoods and the socio-economic activities in Somalia are dependent on water availability from rainfall. The 2030, 2050 and 2070 projected rainfall and temperature change scenarios show that Somalia future development and livelihoods in future will face increased threats of climate extremes unless effective climate smart adaptation systems form integral components of national development strategies. With the prolonging socio economic stability in the country, the development of the required community based effective climate smart adaptation systems will require support from global and regional partners. Efforts to achieve food security in Somalia have long been hampered by climate extremes such as floods and drought, as well as civil wars, political volatility, rapid population growth, among other miseries . Most of the socio-economic activities in Lower Jubba are rain dependent. Recurring drought and floods cause acute stress on a developing economy such as that of Lower Jubba. Flooding in Lower Jubba has been linked to RVF outbreaks which in the past has resulted in a ban in the export of livestock from Somalia and led to massive losses for communities and the Somali economy . Rainfall variability, particularly the projected recurrence of below average extremes in the near future would also impact the rate of restoration of disturbed vegetation. Temperature anomalies indicate recurrences of positive anomalies within all the three projected periods except for OND where some negative anomalies were evident during the first projection period. Seasonal differences, in the observed temperature projections, were quite evident and are major issues that require more studies in order to develop effective and realistic climate change and disaster risk reduction strategies. Long term adaptation planning by the Jubaland Administration for Lower Jubba must take an integrated approach to both floods and drought for both the near, mid and far future. Investment in early warning systems for daily, monthly, seasonal and inter-annual prediction is critical for any effective adaptation strategy. Timely seasonal forecasts and drought monitoring is essential for drought risk reduction in Lower Jubba where livelihoods are closely intertwined with climate variability. The study further provides some important knowledge on rainfall variability and change over the Lower Jubba region that would contribute to the 6th IPCC assessment report on the state of regional climate change over Africa. The knowledge on the past, present and future rainfall patterns derived from this study is important in the development of any effective disaster risk reduction and climate change strategies of Somalia in supporting sustainable development goals, implementation of the Paris UNFCCC, Sendai disaster risk reduction, among other global, regional, national and community based resilience building frameworks.', 'summary': 'Keywords:  Increasing evidence is able to link climate change to major and minor threats to natural systems, threatening environmental, social and economic development .

In Sub-Saharan Africa, vulnerability to climate change for local communities is increased because of their dependence on rain fed agriculture . Large populations in Somalia in particular have experienced severer impacts due to water stress as their livelihoods are dependent on access to water and pasture . 94% of nomadic populations in Somalia are reportedly living in poverty. Somaliaâ\x80\x99s long coastal line provides fishing livelihood systems threatened by unique marine systems that include Somalia ocean currents systems, tropical cyclones and before tropical cyclones. Somalia has seen an increase in frequency and intensity of floods and droughts with severe droughts in 2007/2008, 2011/2012, 2015/16/17 . Climate induced displacement in Somalia continues to increase with UN listing the number of internally displaced persons due to drought between November 2016 and October 2017 at 943,000 . Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (2015-2030) recognized the difficulty in achieving sustainable development without the development of climate smart systems. Climate change impacts are projected to slow down economic growth, making poverty reduction even more difficult, while prolonging existing poverty traps . Climate change risks undermine the sustainability of basic livelihoods, threatening food security, health among other socio-economic impacts. Without proper adaptation measures, the projected increase in frequency and severity of weather and climate extremes will undermine the safety of ecosystems and health . The need to strengthen Somaliaâ\x80\x99s capacity to deal with disasters, such as the protracted droughts and floods that it continues to face, is critical . The study attempted to provide projected rainfall and temperature change scenarios for Lower Jubba region, Somalia. This was done using the downscaled Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) RCMs data. The annual rainfall and temperature cycles simulated by an ensemble of CORDEX RCMs were compared with the observed data. The analysis focused on the Gu long rain season, which had the best agreement in comparison to the observed rainfall data. Projections for temperature were done for all the standard global climatological seasons namely northern hemisphere summer, winter, autumn and spring seasons that correspond to June to August, December to February, September to November, March to May months. The projections of the future Gu long rain season characteristics was done using the IPCC projected periods of 2030, 2050 and 2070 benchmarks. Lower Jubba is located in the Jubaland state of Somalia . Jubaland consists of the Gedo, Lower Jubba and Middle Jubba regions, and lies 40 - 60 km east of the Jubba River, stretching from Gedo to the Indian Ocean. The state of Jubaland borders the Garrisa, Wajir and Mandera County of Kenya on the western side. Kismayo, located in Lower Jubba, is the largest city in Jubaland, and the third largest city in Somalia after Mogadishu and Hargesa . Lower Jubba receives about 350 mm rainfall during Gu (AMJ) season and an average of 250 mm Deyr (SON) season. Lower Jubba saw a general decreasing trend in rainfall during the Gu rainfall season, and a general increasing trend in the Deyr rainfall between 1981 to 2015 . The Lower Jubba region has also experienced an increase in occurrence of depressed rainfall usually associated with drought, and a decrease in the frequency of above normal rainfall associated with floods . Studies on the GHA show a decrease of MAM long rains and increase in the OND short rains . Lower Jubba has seen increasing trends in the minimum, maximum and average temperature, consistent with the results from many recent studies worldwide . Increase in temperature could also change the ecology of infectious diseases as well as increase temperature related mortality and morbidity of people and livestock . Climate Change projections for Somalia will be used to derive information regarding the potential increase of the threats of climate extremes on future development and livelihoods. It will also enable the development of effective climate smart adaptation strategies. Details of area of study, data used and methodologies adopted are highlighted in the following sections. Gridded CHIRPS and GeoCLIM observations for the period 1960-90 were used as the baseline observations data. CHIRPS is a global dataset (50Ë\x9aS - 50Ë\x9aN, 180Ë\x9aE - 180Ë\x9aW), 0.05Ë\x9a resolution, 1981 to near-present gridded precipitation time series. CHIRPS data are produced by scientists at the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) Climate Hazard Group (CHG) and the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Earth Resources Observation and Science (EROS) Center. The data was developed to support the United States Agency for International Development Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET). Rainfall Measuring Mission Multi-satellite Precipitation Analysis version 7 (TMPA 3B42 v7) is used to calibrate global Cold Cloud Duration (CCD) rainfall estimates. Details on CHIRPS data and their usability in the region are well documented by ICPAC among many others . A coordinated set of the 20th and 21st century climate simulations for the Atmosphere Ocean coupled Global Climate Models (AOGCMs) in the Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5) have been contributed to by climate modelling groups from all around the world . Data from the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) Africa framework was used in this study to project scenarios for precipitation in Lower Jubba. The CORDEX program is an initiative by World Climate Research Program (WCRP) of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) that generates high-resolution climate projections (50 km) for climate studies, within the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) timeline and beyond . CORDEX data used in this study represented precipitation fairly well over the region and thus can be used to inform on adaptation and mitigation strategies . These climate models describe the coupling of the atmosphere with the land surface, with differing dynamics and physics formulations . For each experiment the historical runs, forced by observed natural and anthropogenic atmospheric composition, cover the period from 1950-2005. The future projections (2006-2100) are forced with two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP), namely; RCP4.5 (mid-range emissions) and RCP8.5 (high-end emissions) scenarios, which prescribe future atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations and aerosols. Detail on the CORDEX RCMs can be found in Endris and Nikulin . Endris evaluated the ability of the CORDEX RCMs in simulating the general characteristics of the climate over Eastern Africa region by analyzing the annual cycle, spatial variability, pattern correlation and root mean square error using a Taylor diagram. The study found that these RCMs reasonably simulate the main features of the rainfall climatology over eastern Africa and also reproduce the majority of the documented regional responses to ENSO and IOD forcings. At the same time the analysis showed significant biases in individual models depending on sub-region and season; however, the ensemble mean had better agreement with observation than individual models. The analysis concluded that the multi-model ensemble mean simulates eastern Africa rainfall adequately and could therefore be used for the assessment of future climate projections for the region. The CORDEX RCMs data was obtained from IGAD Climate Prediction and Application Centre (ICPAC) which is the WMO regional climate center for the Greater Horn of Africa. In this study the region of interest was Lower Jubba that is bounded by latitudes 1.5Ë\x9aS - 12.0Ë\x9aN and longitudes 41.0Ë\x9aE - 51.0Ë\x9aE. There IPCC based climate projection reference period were used namely 2030 (sub-period 1), sub-period up to 2050 (sub-period 2), and sub-period up to 2070 (sub-period 3). The study was divided into two major sections namely assessment of Model Skill in Simulating Observed Climate during the period 1961-1990, and the projection of future rainfall and temperature scenarios. Standard methods were adopted to determine the best climate model/s that could be used for the projection of future climate change scenarios for Lower Jubba region of Somalia for the two standard rainfall seasons Gu (April to June) and Deyr (September to November). The temperature simulations were for all standard seasons of the year in Somalia namely December-February (DJF), March-May (MAM), July-August (JJA), and September-November (SON). Standard methods were also adopted to test the spatial and temporal bias of the individual models. The methods used included various time series methods, correlation and regression analysis. Correlation methods examined correlations between the observed and simulated outputs at specific grid point locations. The square of the correlation coefficient is knows as coefficient of determination (r2) which represented the variance of the observed data that could be accounted for by the predicted variable. Regression method attempted to fit the best linear mathematical equation for the observed relationships. The statistical significance of the fitted linear regression trends were examined using graphical approaches as well as the standards statistical test that include the use of Mann-Kendall Rank Statistics. Similar methods have been adopted in many studies in Africa and the world at large . A linear regression trend was investigated by examining the relationship between time (T) and the variable of interest (X), in this case rainfall, using the following equation X(t) is the individual observed seasonal rainfall/temperature during the baseline period 1960-1990, while Y(t) are corresponding values simulated by the individual CORDEX models over the period 1961-1990, c and b are normally the intercept and gradient (slope) of the regression equation. The slope indicates the average rate of change in the dependent variable in each year of the given time period. A positive/negative slope shows an increasing/decreasing trend respectively. The limitation of this method is that it assumes that all linkages between observed and CORDEX models generated models are linear, and the distributions of the observed and predicted records are normal. For non-normal data the study included nonparametric tests namely the Mann-Kendall rank statistics method was used. In the Mann-Kendall analysis data is ranked after being placed in time sequential order. The time series values (X1, X2, X3, X4 â\x80¦, Xn) where X in this case represents rainfall are replaced by their relative ranks (R1, R2, R3, R4 â\x80¦, Rn) (starting from the lowest value up to n). The relative magnitudes of sample data is compared rather than the data values themselves . The equation used is as follows, where S is the Kendall score given a dataset R with a sample size of n values. The Kendall statistics s is given in Equation (2) below based on Kendall, 1938; 1945; 1948 The observed trend is significant if s values in Equation (2) have significance levels equal or less than 0.5. The ensemble model data was used in this study to compute the correlation value r and linear trend lines for each pixel for the individual seasons. The results for both correlation coefficient r value and the slope were mapped for each pixel and season. The results from the assessment of Model Skill in Simulating Observed Climate for the various seasons determined the models and seasons that were projected into the future using CORDEX RCA4.5 models. The three sub-periods used in the projections included the sub-periods up to 2030 (sub-period 1), up to 2050 (sub-period 2), and up to 2070 (sub-period 3). The results from model verification and climate change projections with CORDEX RCA4.5 models are independently highlighted in the following sections. The annual cycle of Gu (AMJ) and Deyr (SON) season rainfall for the baseline period 1960-90 from gridded CHIRPS observations and CORDEX RCMs simulated outputs were compared the study area in order to determine the best ensemble models that can be used for the future climate change rainfall projections. Future projections of temperature were undertaken for all the four standard seasons of the year. Figure 1(a) and Figure 1(b) illustrate the performance of CORDEX RCMs in simulating annual rainfall and temperature cycles over the study area as compared to the CHIRPS data. All of the RCMs capture fairly well the rainfall seasonality in Lower Jubba. Figure 1(a) shows that the north-south rainfall pattern follows the migration of the ITCZ, with associated locations of maximum rainfall being depicted fairly well by the ensemble model. For the study area, the ensemble mean results were found to simulate fairly well the annual rainfall cycle when compared to individual RCM models. In general, the study revealed some fairly good agreement between annual rainfall cycle simulated by ensemble of CORDEX RCMs and the CHIRPS data. The most notable shortcoming in most individual RCMs is the early peak and overestimation of the mean monthly rainfall particularly in the Deyr season (Figure 1(a)). Studies have shown that GCMs tend to overestimate rainfall in the Horn of Africa region during October to December season . IPCC reports have indicated limitation in the extent of skilful rainfall projection due to the nonlinear and chaotic nature of the climate system . Results from the study showed that the ensemble models closely reproduced realistic representation of the observed climate features. Figure 1(b) shows the performance of CORDEX RCMs in simulating the mean surface temperature over Jubaland compared to the observed temperature data. The ensemble model seems to overestimate temperature when compared to the observed data during the hot months of Jan-April while underestimate during July to December, Figure 1(b). The results from the study indicated that the multi-model ensembles outperformed the individual RCM model as shown in Figure 2(a) and Figure 2(b). All of the RCMs however captured fairly well the rainfall seasonality in Lower Jubba, though significant biases can be found in individual models depending on the seasons as seen in Figure 2(a). The model bias for precipitation in each individual model varies from month to month. NOAA, CNRM and MPI and overestimated the rainfall data between August and November while MIROC underestimates the rainfall data in the same period. Figure 2(b) also showed variation in performance of the RCMs from month to month even with the temperature data. ICHEC underestimated the temperatures between January and June, while NOAA underestimated the data between July and December. MOCH and NCC overestimated the data in April. Similar results are from some previous studies for the Multi-model ensemble projections . It observed from the examination of the skill of the individual CORDEX models and ensemble models simulation observed CHIRPS and GEOCLIM data over the period 1961-1990 best during Gu (AMJ) season. Thus projection of future rainfall scenarios was undertaken for only the Gu (AMJ) season. The projections undertaken for temperature were observed for all seasons. It observed from the examination of the skill of the individual CORDEX models and ensemble models simulation observed CHIRPS and GEOCLIM data over the period 1961-1990 best during Gu (AMJ) season. Thus projection of future rainfall scenarios was undertaken for only the Gu (AMJ) season. The projections undertaken for temperature were observed for all seasons. The results for future projections of rainfall and temperature with the CORDEX RCMs are given below for IPCC sub periods of 2030, 2050 and 2070. The simulations of rainfall concentrated on the Gu (April-June) season, where most models showed more realistic simulations of rainfall. The geographical distribution exhibits notable spatial variability in rainfall over Lower Jubba. Badhaadhe district towards the southern coast exhibits the highest amount of rainfall as seen in Table 1. The southern costal region shows the highest projected amount of rainfall in Lower Jubba throughout all three sub-periods as was seen with the historical data published . The patterns of the projected changes in seasonal ensemble mean Gu rainfall for the three sub-periods namely 2030, 2050 and 2070 showed significant variations in the magnitude of the projected seasonal rainfall from place to place, season, sub-periods and scenarios. There is a general increase in rainfall in Lower Jubba from 2030 to 2070. The projected rainfall is however not homogeneous throughout the region with the inland region receiving the least amount of rainfall. Similar results are reported in the Somali NAPA which shows an increase in rainfall in 2050 and 2080 . This is also supported by IPCC studies that project an increase in MAM rainfall in 2050-2100 in most parts of Eastern Africa . North eastern Kenya bordering Lower Jubba is projected to receive an increase in rainfall of 40% relative to the baseline period (1981-2010) by 2100 during its long rain season . Table 1 shows the range of seasonal precipitation from the projected ensemble data for Gu, averaged over the districts in Jubaland, with RCP4.5 scenario for the three sub-periods 2030, 2050 and 2070. The observed trends of the temporal evolution of the projected precipitation over this region are shown in Figures 3(a)-(c). The results show a decreasing trend for the first sub-period Figure 3(a), followed by an increasing trend for the second and third sub-periods Figure 3(b) and Figure 3(c). The trends are however not statistically significant at a 95% confidence level. Despite being statistically insignificant the results are similar to those of studies over the region . For Africa, IPCC projects that almost all countries except South Africa will probably experience a significant reduction in precipitation until 2050 which then increases significantly between 2050 and 2100 corroborating the results displayed in Figures 3(a)-(c). The averaged mean water vapor, evaporation and precipitation are projected to increase globally by 2100 . The use of climate change knowledge, particularly when mainstreamed into planned policies and poverty reduction strategies can provide a starting point for the identification of climate risks at a district, regional and national level. The projected rainfall further shows dominant dry and wet phases of the Gu season in the future (Figure 4), which calls for sustained investment in early warning mechanisms, and water management systems. The spatial representation of the projected rainfall trends showed no homogenous patterns throughout the three study sub periods. While some areas in Lower Jubba are projected to have general decrease in rainfall during the long rain season, other areas were projected to have a general increase in rainfall (Table 2). General increasing trend was however seen throughout Lower Jubba, with different magnitude of the changes. Details of the pattern in the trend in each district can be seen in Table 2. Although the projected rainfall trends were still not statistically significant, the complexity of the observed characteristics of the changes continues to call for further studies and tailored mitigation and adaptation strategies over the region of study. Individual rainfall time series shown in Figure 5 further indicate general dominance of depressed rainfall during the sub period ending in 2030, followed with dominance of positive rainfall anomalies during the last two sub-periods ending in 2050 and 2070. These results signify the need for investment in early warning mechanisms in Lower Jubba. Results on Lower Jubba are similar to projected results for Africa, where the impacts of climate change will be exacerbated by widespread poverty, diseases and high population growth rates, which would intensify the demand for food, water and livestock . The projected recurrence of depressed rainfall for the near future is significant for a country that is already highly vulnerable with high poverty levels across multiple dimensions . Somalia is already experiencing food insecurity, the implication of a further risk to food and water security could pause a threat on security in a struggle for available resources. Furthermore, results from this study have shown that communities in Lower Jubba revert to charcoal production when their livelihoods are threatened, the impact of which is forest degradation. The recurrence of extreme below normal rainfall often associated with drought is also evident, given the communities use of charcoal as an adaptation strategy, an increase in deforestation and degradation can be expected. The projected precipitation presented in this study call for urgency in finding short and mid-term solutions. The increase in above average rainfall associated with floods as seen in Figure 4 by in sub-period 2 (2050) is also consistent with Tierney, et al. and IPCC that projects increased precipitation in Africa generally during the same period . The magnitude of the extreme above and below average rainfall for the projected future is not the same as seen in Figure 4. Similar results in the bordering regions in Kenya, project an increase in intensity of rainfall, and extreme rainfall events . The spatial pattern of the projected seasonal ensemble mean surface temperature based on the RCMs are shown for the three sub-periods namely 2030, 2050 and 2070 relative to the baseline period showed general warming at most locations over the three sub periods ending in 2030, 2050 and 2070. Results however show that projected change in temperature will vary from season to season and district to district. Like the observed GISTEMP data, the average temperature seems to increase towards the southern costal band in all seasons, possibly due to influence by Indian Ocean . The ensemble models however seemed to overestimate the temperature in JJA which according to the observed data should register the lowest temperature. Results from the temperature time series (Figure 6) show an increasing temperatures in both the near to long term future. This is in line with global and regional reports that project an increase in the average temperature by 2030 and a further increase by 2050 . Results are statistically significant at 95% confidence level. Changes in temperature and humidity are reportedly linked to increased vector borne diseases and helminthes infections . This will also have far reaching implications on many socio-economic sectors. Figure 5 shows the anomalies in the projected temperature time series. Results are similar to IPCC reports projecting more hot and fewer cold temperature extremes in most places as global mean temperatures increase in a seasonal time scale. Results showed the rate of increase in temperature by 0.3 to 0.7 degrees by 2035. The unique patterns of the temperature time series is the tendencies for the annual temperature extremes to be generally higher that the preceding years. WMO recent observations have shown such tendencies in the recent years for the annual mean temperature time series. In general, the projections for Lower Jubba indicated an increase in minimum and maximum temperatures in all seasons in the projection periods 2030, 2050 and 2070. Temperature projections are critical in the development of effective and realistic climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction strategies. The impact of an increasing temperature would be far reaching for most socio-economic sectors including community safety, water, food, energy, infrastructure, among others . The projected temperature would also exacerbate health issues with heat related morbidity and mortality in Africa being projected to increase . Studies have also projected that the geographical distribution of disease prone areas like Malaria will increase as climatic conditions change, creating more conducive conditions for new diseases to breed in areas that were previously disease free . Projected rainfall change patterns indicated significant increase in high rainfall extremes were exhibited in periods leading up to 2050 and 2070. In the case of temperature, the projections from all the models showed increase in minimum and maximum temperatures in all seasons and sub periods, like being observed temperature projection over other parts of the world. Most of livelihoods and the socio-economic activities in Somalia are dependent on water availability from rainfall. The 2030, 2050 and 2070 projected rainfall and temperature change scenarios show that Somalia future development and livelihoods in future will face increased threats of climate extremes unless effective climate smart adaptation systems form integral components of national development strategies. With the prolonging socio economic stability in the country, the development of the required community based effective climate smart adaptation systems will require support from global and regional partners. Efforts to achieve food security in Somalia have long been hampered by climate extremes such as floods and drought, as well as civil wars, political volatility, rapid population growth, among other miseries . Most of the socio-economic activities in Lower Jubba are rain dependent. Recurring drought and floods cause acute stress on a developing economy such as that of Lower Jubba. Flooding in Lower Jubba has been linked to RVF outbreaks which in the past has resulted in a ban in the export of livestock from Somalia and led to massive losses for communities and the Somali economy . Rainfall variability, particularly the projected recurrence of below average extremes in the near future would also impact the rate of restoration of disturbed vegetation. Temperature anomalies indicate recurrences of positive anomalies within all the three projected periods except for OND where some negative anomalies were evident during the first projection period. Seasonal differences, in the observed temperature projections, were quite evident and are major issues that require more studies in order to develop effective and realistic climate change and disaster risk reduction strategies. Long term adaptation planning by the Jubaland Administration for Lower Jubba must take an integrated approach to both floods and drought for both the near, mid and far future. Investment in early warning systems for daily, monthly, seasonal and inter-annual prediction is critical for any effective adaptation strategy. Timely seasonal forecasts and drought monitoring is essential for drought risk reduction in Lower Jubba where livelihoods are closely intertwined with climate variability. The study further provides some important knowledge on rainfall variability and change over the Lower Jubba region that would contribute to the 6th IPCC assessment report on the state of regional climate change over Africa. The knowledge on the past, present and future rainfall patterns derived from this study is important in the development of any effective disaster risk reduction and climate change strategies of Somalia in supporting sustainable development goals, implementation of the Paris UNFCCC, Sendai disaster risk reduction, among other global, regional, national and community based resilience building frameworks.', 'summary': 'Keywords:  Increasing evidence is able to link climate change to major and minor threats to natural systems, threatening environmental, social and economic development .

In Sub-Saharan Africa, vulnerability to climate change for local communities is increased because of their dependence on rain fed agriculture . Large populations in Somalia in particular have experienced severer impacts due to water stress as their livelihoods are dependent on access to water and pasture . 94% of nomadic populations in Somalia are reportedly living in poverty. Somaliaâ\x80\x99s long coastal line provides fishing livelihood systems threatened by unique marine systems that include Somalia ocean currents systems, tropical cyclones and before tropical cyclones. Somalia has seen an increase in frequency and intensity of floods and droughts with severe droughts in 2007/2008, 2011/2012, 2015/16/17 . Climate induced displacement in Somalia continues to increase with UN listing the number of internally displaced persons due to drought between November 2016 and October 2017 at 943,000 . Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (2015-2030) recognized the difficulty in achieving sustainable development without the development of climate smart systems. Climate change impacts are projected to slow down economic growth, making poverty reduction even more difficult, while prolonging existing poverty traps . Climate change risks undermine the sustainability of basic livelihoods, threatening food security, health among other socio-economic impacts. Without proper adaptation measures, the projected increase in frequency and severity of weather and climate extremes will undermine the safety of ecosystems and health . The need to strengthen Somaliaâ\x80\x99s capacity to deal with disasters, such as the protracted droughts and floods that it continues to face, is critical . The study attempted to provide projected rainfall and temperature change scenarios for Lower Jubba region, Somalia. This was done using the downscaled Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) RCMs data. The annual rainfall and temperature cycles simulated by an ensemble of CORDEX RCMs were compared with the observed data. The analysis focused on the Gu long rain season, which had the best agreement in comparison to the observed rainfall data. Projections for temperature were done for all the standard global climatological seasons namely northern hemisphere summer, winter, autumn and spring seasons that correspond to June to August, December to February, September to November, March to May months. The projections of the future Gu long rain season characteristics was done using the IPCC projected periods of 2030, 2050 and 2070 benchmarks. Lower Jubba is located in the Jubaland state of Somalia . Jubaland consists of the Gedo, Lower Jubba and Middle Jubba regions, and lies 40 - 60 km east of the Jubba River, stretching from Gedo to the Indian Ocean. The state of Jubaland borders the Garrisa, Wajir and Mandera County of Kenya on the western side. Kismayo, located in Lower Jubba, is the largest city in Jubaland, and the third largest city in Somalia after Mogadishu and Hargesa . Lower Jubba receives about 350 mm rainfall during Gu (AMJ) season and an average of 250 mm Deyr (SON) season. Lower Jubba saw a general decreasing trend in rainfall during the Gu rainfall season, and a general increasing trend in the Deyr rainfall between 1981 to 2015 . The Lower Jubba region has also experienced an increase in occurrence of depressed rainfall usually associated with drought, and a decrease in the frequency of above normal rainfall associated with floods . Studies on the GHA show a decrease of MAM long rains and increase in the OND short rains . Lower Jubba has seen increasing trends in the minimum, maximum and average temperature, consistent with the results from many recent studies worldwide . Increase in temperature could also change the ecology of infectious diseases as well as increase temperature related mortality and morbidity of people and livestock . Climate Change projections for Somalia will be used to derive information regarding the potential increase of the threats of climate extremes on future development and livelihoods. It will also enable the development of effective climate smart adaptation strategies. Details of area of study, data used and methodologies adopted are highlighted in the following sections. Gridded CHIRPS and GeoCLIM observations for the period 1960-90 were used as the baseline observations data. CHIRPS is a global dataset (50Ë\x9aS - 50Ë\x9aN, 180Ë\x9aE - 180Ë\x9aW), 0.05Ë\x9a resolution, 1981 to near-present gridded precipitation time series. CHIRPS data are produced by scientists at the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) Climate Hazard Group (CHG) and the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Earth Resources Observation and Science (EROS) Center. The data was developed to support the United States Agency for International Development Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET). Rainfall Measuring Mission Multi-satellite Precipitation Analysis version 7 (TMPA 3B42 v7) is used to calibrate global Cold Cloud Duration (CCD) rainfall estimates. Details on CHIRPS data and their usability in the region are well documented by ICPAC among many others . A coordinated set of the 20th and 21st century climate simulations for the Atmosphere Ocean coupled Global Climate Models (AOGCMs) in the Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5) have been contributed to by climate modelling groups from all around the world . Data from the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) Africa framework was used in this study to project scenarios for precipitation in Lower Jubba. The CORDEX program is an initiative by World Climate Research Program (WCRP) of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) that generates high-resolution climate projections (50 km) for climate studies, within the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) timeline and beyond . CORDEX data used in this study represented precipitation fairly well over the region and thus can be used to inform on adaptation and mitigation strategies . These climate models describe the coupling of the atmosphere with the land surface, with differing dynamics and physics formulations . For each experiment the historical runs, forced by observed natural and anthropogenic atmospheric composition, cover the period from 1950-2005. The future projections (2006-2100) are forced with two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP), namely; RCP4.5 (mid-range emissions) and RCP8.5 (high-end emissions) scenarios, which prescribe future atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations and aerosols. Detail on the CORDEX RCMs can be found in Endris and Nikulin . Endris evaluated the ability of the CORDEX RCMs in simulating the general characteristics of the climate over Eastern Africa region by analyzing the annual cycle, spatial variability, pattern correlation and root mean square error using a Taylor diagram. The study found that these RCMs reasonably simulate the main features of the rainfall climatology over eastern Africa and also reproduce the majority of the documented regional responses to ENSO and IOD forcings. At the same time the analysis showed significant biases in individual models depending on sub-region and season; however, the ensemble mean had better agreement with observation than individual models. The analysis concluded that the multi-model ensemble mean simulates eastern Africa rainfall adequately and could therefore be used for the assessment of future climate projections for the region. The CORDEX RCMs data was obtained from IGAD Climate Prediction and Application Centre (ICPAC) which is the WMO regional climate center for the Greater Horn of Africa. In this study the region of interest was Lower Jubba that is bounded by latitudes 1.5Ë\x9aS - 12.0Ë\x9aN and longitudes 41.0Ë\x9aE - 51.0Ë\x9aE. There IPCC based climate projection reference period were used namely 2030 (sub-period 1), sub-period up to 2050 (sub-period 2), and sub-period up to 2070 (sub-period 3). The study was divided into two major sections namely assessment of Model Skill in Simulating Observed Climate during the period 1961-1990, and the projection of future rainfall and temperature scenarios. Standard methods were adopted to determine the best climate model/s that could be used for the projection of future climate change scenarios for Lower Jubba region of Somalia for the two standard rainfall seasons Gu (April to June) and Deyr (September to November). The temperature simulations were for all standard seasons of the year in Somalia namely December-February (DJF), March-May (MAM), July-August (JJA), and September-November (SON). Standard methods were also adopted to test the spatial and temporal bias of the individual models. The methods used included various time series methods, correlation and regression analysis. Correlation methods examined correlations between the observed and simulated outputs at specific grid point locations. The square of the correlation coefficient is knows as coefficient of determination (r2) which represented the variance of the observed data that could be accounted for by the predicted variable. Regression method attempted to fit the best linear mathematical equation for the observed relationships. The statistical significance of the fitted linear regression trends were examined using graphical approaches as well as the standards statistical test that include the use of Mann-Kendall Rank Statistics. Similar methods have been adopted in many studies in Africa and the world at large . A linear regression trend was investigated by examining the relationship between time (T) and the variable of interest (X), in this case rainfall, using the following equation X(t) is the individual observed seasonal rainfall/temperature during the baseline period 1960-1990, while Y(t) are corresponding values simulated by the individual CORDEX models over the period 1961-1990, c and b are normally the intercept and gradient (slope) of the regression equation. The slope indicates the average rate of change in the dependent variable in each year of the given time period. A positive/negative slope shows an increasing/decreasing trend respectively. The limitation of this method is that it assumes that all linkages between observed and CORDEX models generated models are linear, and the distributions of the observed and predicted records are normal. For non-normal data the study included nonparametric tests namely the Mann-Kendall rank statistics method was used. In the Mann-Kendall analysis data is ranked after being placed in time sequential order. The time series values (X1, X2, X3, X4 â\x80¦, Xn) where X in this case represents rainfall are replaced by their relative ranks (R1, R2, R3, R4 â\x80¦, Rn) (starting from the lowest value up to n). The relative magnitudes of sample data is compared rather than the data values themselves . The equation used is as follows, where S is the Kendall score given a dataset R with a sample size of n values. The Kendall statistics s is given in Equation (2) below based on Kendall, 1938; 1945; 1948 The observed trend is significant if s values in Equation (2) have significance levels equal or less than 0.5. The ensemble model data was used in this study to compute the correlation value r and linear trend lines for each pixel for the individual seasons. The results for both correlation coefficient r value and the slope were mapped for each pixel and season. The results from the assessment of Model Skill in Simulating Observed Climate for the various seasons determined the models and seasons that were projected into the future using CORDEX RCA4.5 models. The three sub-periods used in the projections included the sub-periods up to 2030 (sub-period 1), up to 2050 (sub-period 2), and up to 2070 (sub-period 3). The results from model verification and climate change projections with CORDEX RCA4.5 models are independently highlighted in the following sections. The annual cycle of Gu (AMJ) and Deyr (SON) season rainfall for the baseline period 1960-90 from gridded CHIRPS observations and CORDEX RCMs simulated outputs were compared the study area in order to determine the best ensemble models that can be used for the future climate change rainfall projections. Future projections of temperature were undertaken for all the four standard seasons of the year. Figure 1(a) and Figure 1(b) illustrate the performance of CORDEX RCMs in simulating annual rainfall and temperature cycles over the study area as compared to the CHIRPS data. All of the RCMs capture fairly well the rainfall seasonality in Lower Jubba. Figure 1(a) shows that the north-south rainfall pattern follows the migration of the ITCZ, with associated locations of maximum rainfall being depicted fairly well by the ensemble model. For the study area, the ensemble mean results were found to simulate fairly well the annual rainfall cycle when compared to individual RCM models. In general, the study revealed some fairly good agreement between annual rainfall cycle simulated by ensemble of CORDEX RCMs and the CHIRPS data. The most notable shortcoming in most individual RCMs is the early peak and overestimation of the mean monthly rainfall particularly in the Deyr season (Figure 1(a)). Studies have shown that GCMs tend to overestimate rainfall in the Horn of Africa region during October to December season . IPCC reports have indicated limitation in the extent of skilful rainfall projection due to the nonlinear and chaotic nature of the climate system . Results from the study showed that the ensemble models closely reproduced realistic representation of the observed climate features. Figure 1(b) shows the performance of CORDEX RCMs in simulating the mean surface temperature over Jubaland compared to the observed temperature data. The ensemble model seems to overestimate temperature when compared to the observed data during the hot months of Jan-April while underestimate during July to December, Figure 1(b). The results from the study indicated that the multi-model ensembles outperformed the individual RCM model as shown in Figure 2(a) and Figure 2(b). All of the RCMs however captured fairly well the rainfall seasonality in Lower Jubba, though significant biases can be found in individual models depending on the seasons as seen in Figure 2(a). The model bias for precipitation in each individual model varies from month to month. NOAA, CNRM and MPI and overestimated the rainfall data between August and November while MIROC underestimates the rainfall data in the same period. Figure 2(b) also showed variation in performance of the RCMs from month to month even with the temperature data. ICHEC underestimated the temperatures between January and June, while NOAA underestimated the data between July and December. MOCH and NCC overestimated the data in April. Similar results are from some previous studies for the Multi-model ensemble projections . It observed from the examination of the skill of the individual CORDEX models and ensemble models simulation observed CHIRPS and GEOCLIM data over the period 1961-1990 best during Gu (AMJ) season. Thus projection of future rainfall scenarios was undertaken for only the Gu (AMJ) season. The projections undertaken for temperature were observed for all seasons. It observed from the examination of the skill of the individual CORDEX models and ensemble models simulation observed CHIRPS and GEOCLIM data over the period 1961-1990 best during Gu (AMJ) season. Thus projection of future rainfall scenarios was undertaken for only the Gu (AMJ) season. The projections undertaken for temperature were observed for all seasons. The results for future projections of rainfall and temperature with the CORDEX RCMs are given below for IPCC sub periods of 2030, 2050 and 2070. The simulations of rainfall concentrated on the Gu (April-June) season, where most models showed more realistic simulations of rainfall. The geographical distribution exhibits notable spatial variability in rainfall over Lower Jubba. Badhaadhe district towards the southern coast exhibits the highest amount of rainfall as seen in Table 1. The southern costal region shows the highest projected amount of rainfall in Lower Jubba throughout all three sub-periods as was seen with the historical data published . The patterns of the projected changes in seasonal ensemble mean Gu rainfall for the three sub-periods namely 2030, 2050 and 2070 showed significant variations in the magnitude of the projected seasonal rainfall from place to place, season, sub-periods and scenarios. There is a general increase in rainfall in Lower Jubba from 2030 to 2070. The projected rainfall is however not homogeneous throughout the region with the inland region receiving the least amount of rainfall. Similar results are reported in the Somali NAPA which shows an increase in rainfall in 2050 and 2080 . This is also supported by IPCC studies that project an increase in MAM rainfall in 2050-2100 in most parts of Eastern Africa . North eastern Kenya bordering Lower Jubba is projected to receive an increase in rainfall of 40% relative to the baseline period (1981-2010) by 2100 during its long rain season . Table 1 shows the range of seasonal precipitation from the projected ensemble data for Gu, averaged over the districts in Jubaland, with RCP4.5 scenario for the three sub-periods 2030, 2050 and 2070. The observed trends of the temporal evolution of the projected precipitation over this region are shown in Figures 3(a)-(c). The results show a decreasing trend for the first sub-period Figure 3(a), followed by an increasing trend for the second and third sub-periods Figure 3(b) and Figure 3(c). The trends are however not statistically significant at a 95% confidence level. Despite being statistically insignificant the results are similar to those of studies over the region . For Africa, IPCC projects that almost all countries except South Africa will probably experience a significant reduction in precipitation until 2050 which then increases significantly between 2050 and 2100 corroborating the results displayed in Figures 3(a)-(c). The averaged mean water vapor, evaporation and precipitation are projected to increase globally by 2100 . The use of climate change knowledge, particularly when mainstreamed into planned policies and poverty reduction strategies can provide a starting point for the identification of climate risks at a district, regional and national level. The projected rainfall further shows dominant dry and wet phases of the Gu season in the future (Figure 4), which calls for sustained investment in early warning mechanisms, and water management systems. The spatial representation of the projected rainfall trends showed no homogenous patterns throughout the three study sub periods. While some areas in Lower Jubba are projected to have general decrease in rainfall during the long rain season, other areas were projected to have a general increase in rainfall (Table 2). General increasing trend was however seen throughout Lower Jubba, with different magnitude of the changes. Details of the pattern in the trend in each district can be seen in Table 2. Although the projected rainfall trends were still not statistically significant, the complexity of the observed characteristics of the changes continues to call for further studies and tailored mitigation and adaptation strategies over the region of study. Individual rainfall time series shown in Figure 5 further indicate general dominance of depressed rainfall during the sub period ending in 2030, followed with dominance of positive rainfall anomalies during the last two sub-periods ending in 2050 and 2070. These results signify the need for investment in early warning mechanisms in Lower Jubba. Results on Lower Jubba are similar to projected results for Africa, where the impacts of climate change will be exacerbated by widespread poverty, diseases and high population growth rates, which would intensify the demand for food, water and livestock . The projected recurrence of depressed rainfall for the near future is significant for a country that is already highly vulnerable with high poverty levels across multiple dimensions . Somalia is already experiencing food insecurity, the implication of a further risk to food and water security could pause a threat on security in a struggle for available resources. Furthermore, results from this study have shown that communities in Lower Jubba revert to charcoal production when their livelihoods are threatened, the impact of which is forest degradation. The recurrence of extreme below normal rainfall often associated with drought is also evident, given the communities use of charcoal as an adaptation strategy, an increase in deforestation and degradation can be expected. The projected precipitation presented in this study call for urgency in finding short and mid-term solutions. The increase in above average rainfall associated with floods as seen in Figure 4 by in sub-period 2 (2050) is also consistent with Tierney, et al. and IPCC that projects increased precipitation in Africa generally during the same period . The magnitude of the extreme above and below average rainfall for the projected future is not the same as seen in Figure 4. Similar results in the bordering regions in Kenya, project an increase in intensity of rainfall, and extreme rainfall events . The spatial pattern of the projected seasonal ensemble mean surface temperature based on the RCMs are shown for the three sub-periods namely 2030, 2050 and 2070 relative to the baseline period showed general warming at most locations over the three sub periods ending in 2030, 2050 and 2070. Results however show that projected change in temperature will vary from season to season and district to district. Like the observed GISTEMP data, the average temperature seems to increase towards the southern costal band in all seasons, possibly due to influence by Indian Ocean . The ensemble models however seemed to overestimate the temperature in JJA which according to the observed data should register the lowest temperature. Results from the temperature time series (Figure 6) show an increasing temperatures in both the near to long term future. This is in line with global and regional reports that project an increase in the average temperature by 2030 and a further increase by 2050 . Results are statistically significant at 95% confidence level. Changes in temperature and humidity are reportedly linked to increased vector borne diseases and helminthes infections . This will also have far reaching implications on many socio-economic sectors. Figure 5 shows the anomalies in the projected temperature time series. Results are similar to IPCC reports projecting more hot and fewer cold temperature extremes in most places as global mean temperatures increase in a seasonal time scale. Results showed the rate of increase in temperature by 0.3 to 0.7 degrees by 2035. The unique patterns of the temperature time series is the tendencies for the annual temperature extremes to be generally higher that the preceding years. WMO recent observations have shown such tendencies in the recent years for the annual mean temperature time series. In general, the projections for Lower Jubba indicated an increase in minimum and maximum temperatures in all seasons in the projection periods 2030, 2050 and 2070. Temperature projections are critical in the development of effective and realistic climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction strategies. The impact of an increasing temperature would be far reaching for most socio-economic sectors including community safety, water, food, energy, infrastructure, among others . The projected temperature would also exacerbate health issues with heat related morbidity and mortality in Africa being projected to increase . Studies have also projected that the geographical distribution of disease prone areas like Malaria will increase as climatic conditions change, creating more conducive conditions for new diseases to breed in areas that were previously disease free . Projected rainfall change patterns indicated significant increase in high rainfall extremes were exhibited in periods leading up to 2050 and 2070. In the case of temperature, the projections from all the models showed increase in minimum and maximum temperatures in all seasons and sub periods, like being observed temperature projection over other parts of the world. Most of livelihoods and the socio-economic activities in Somalia are dependent on water availability from rainfall. The 2030, 2050 and 2070 projected rainfall and temperature change scenarios show that Somalia future development and livelihoods in future will face increased threats of climate extremes unless effective climate smart adaptation systems form integral components of national development strategies. With the prolonging socio economic stability in the country, the development of the required community based effective climate smart adaptation systems will require support from global and regional partners. Efforts to achieve food security in Somalia have long been hampered by climate extremes such as floods and drought, as well as civil wars, political volatility, rapid population growth, among other miseries . Most of the socio-economic activities in Lower Jubba are rain dependent. Recurring drought and floods cause acute stress on a developing economy such as that of Lower Jubba. Flooding in Lower Jubba has been linked to RVF outbreaks which in the past has resulted in a ban in the export of livestock from Somalia and led to massive losses for communities and the Somali economy . Rainfall variability, particularly the projected recurrence of below average extremes in the near future would also impact the rate of restoration of disturbed vegetation. Temperature anomalies indicate recurrences of positive anomalies within all the three projected periods except for OND where some negative anomalies were evident during the first projection period. Seasonal differences, in the observed temperature projections, were quite evident and are major issues that require more studies in order to develop effective and realistic climate change and disaster risk reduction strategies. Long term adaptation planning by the Jubaland Administration for Lower Jubba must take an integrated approach to both floods and drought for both the near, mid and far future. Investment in early warning systems for daily, monthly, seasonal and inter-annual prediction is critical for any effective adaptation strategy. Timely seasonal forecasts and drought monitoring is essential for drought risk reduction in Lower Jubba where livelihoods are closely intertwined with climate variability. The study further provides some important knowledge on rainfall variability and change over the Lower Jubba region that would contribute to the 6th IPCC assessment report on the state of regional climate change over Africa. The knowledge on the past, present and future rainfall patterns derived from this study is important in the development of any effective disaster risk reduction and climate change strategies of Somalia in supporting sustainable development goals, implementation of the Paris UNFCCC, Sendai disaster risk reduction, among other global, regional, national and community based resilience building frameworks.', 'summary': 'Keywords:  Increasing evidence is able to link climate change to major and minor threats to natural systems, threatening environmental, social and economic development .

In Sub-Saharan Africa, vulnerability to climate change for local communities is increased because of their dependence on rain fed agriculture . Large populations in Somalia in particular have experienced severer impacts due to water stress as their livelihoods are dependent on access to water and pasture . 94% of nomadic populations in Somalia are reportedly living in poverty. Somaliaâ\x80\x99s long coastal line provides fishing livelihood systems threatened by unique marine systems that include Somalia ocean currents systems, tropical cyclones and before tropical cyclones. Somalia has seen an increase in frequency and intensity of floods and droughts with severe droughts in 2007/2008, 2011/2012, 2015/16/17 . Climate induced displacement in Somalia continues to increase with UN listing the number of internally displaced persons due to drought between November 2016 and October 2017 at 943,000 . Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (2015-2030) recognized the difficulty in achieving sustainable development without the development of climate smart systems. Climate change impacts are projected to slow down economic growth, making poverty reduction even more difficult, while prolonging existing poverty traps . Climate change risks undermine the sustainability of basic livelihoods, threatening food security, health among other socio-economic impacts. Without proper adaptation measures, the projected increase in frequency and severity of weather and climate extremes will undermine the safety of ecosystems and health . The need to strengthen Somaliaâ\x80\x99s capacity to deal with disasters, such as the protracted droughts and floods that it continues to face, is critical . The study attempted to provide projected rainfall and temperature change scenarios for Lower Jubba region, Somalia. This was done using the downscaled Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) RCMs data. The annual rainfall and temperature cycles simulated by an ensemble of CORDEX RCMs were compared with the observed data. The analysis focused on the Gu long rain season, which had the best agreement in comparison to the observed rainfall data. Projections for temperature were done for all the standard global climatological seasons namely northern hemisphere summer, winter, autumn and spring seasons that correspond to June to August, December to February, September to November, March to May months. The projections of the future Gu long rain season characteristics was done using the IPCC projected periods of 2030, 2050 and 2070 benchmarks. Lower Jubba is located in the Jubaland state of Somalia . Jubaland consists of the Gedo, Lower Jubba and Middle Jubba regions, and lies 40 - 60 km east of the Jubba River, stretching from Gedo to the Indian Ocean. The state of Jubaland borders the Garrisa, Wajir and Mandera County of Kenya on the western side. Kismayo, located in Lower Jubba, is the largest city in Jubaland, and the third largest city in Somalia after Mogadishu and Hargesa . Lower Jubba receives about 350 mm rainfall during Gu (AMJ) season and an average of 250 mm Deyr (SON) season. Lower Jubba saw a general decreasing trend in rainfall during the Gu rainfall season, and a general increasing trend in the Deyr rainfall between 1981 to 2015 . The Lower Jubba region has also experienced an increase in occurrence of depressed rainfall usually associated with drought, and a decrease in the frequency of above normal rainfall associated with floods . Studies on the GHA show a decrease of MAM long rains and increase in the OND short rains . Lower Jubba has seen increasing trends in the minimum, maximum and average temperature, consistent with the results from many recent studies worldwide . Increase in temperature could also change the ecology of infectious diseases as well as increase temperature related mortality and morbidity of people and livestock . Climate Change projections for Somalia will be used to derive information regarding the potential increase of the threats of climate extremes on future development and livelihoods. It will also enable the development of effective climate smart adaptation strategies. Details of area of study, data used and methodologies adopted are highlighted in the following sections. Gridded CHIRPS and GeoCLIM observations for the period 1960-90 were used as the baseline observations data. CHIRPS is a global dataset (50Ë\x9aS - 50Ë\x9aN, 180Ë\x9aE - 180Ë\x9aW), 0.05Ë\x9a resolution, 1981 to near-present gridded precipitation time series. CHIRPS data are produced by scientists at the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) Climate Hazard Group (CHG) and the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Earth Resources Observation and Science (EROS) Center. The data was developed to support the United States Agency for International Development Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET). Rainfall Measuring Mission Multi-satellite Precipitation Analysis version 7 (TMPA 3B42 v7) is used to calibrate global Cold Cloud Duration (CCD) rainfall estimates. Details on CHIRPS data and their usability in the region are well documented by ICPAC among many others . A coordinated set of the 20th and 21st century climate simulations for the Atmosphere Ocean coupled Global Climate Models (AOGCMs) in the Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5) have been contributed to by climate modelling groups from all around the world . Data from the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) Africa framework was used in this study to project scenarios for precipitation in Lower Jubba. The CORDEX program is an initiative by World Climate Research Program (WCRP) of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) that generates high-resolution climate projections (50 km) for climate studies, within the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) timeline and beyond . CORDEX data used in this study represented precipitation fairly well over the region and thus can be used to inform on adaptation and mitigation strategies . These climate models describe the coupling of the atmosphere with the land surface, with differing dynamics and physics formulations . For each experiment the historical runs, forced by observed natural and anthropogenic atmospheric composition, cover the period from 1950-2005. The future projections (2006-2100) are forced with two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP), namely; RCP4.5 (mid-range emissions) and RCP8.5 (high-end emissions) scenarios, which prescribe future atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations and aerosols. Detail on the CORDEX RCMs can be found in Endris and Nikulin . Endris evaluated the ability of the CORDEX RCMs in simulating the general characteristics of the climate over Eastern Africa region by analyzing the annual cycle, spatial variability, pattern correlation and root mean square error using a Taylor diagram. The study found that these RCMs reasonably simulate the main features of the rainfall climatology over eastern Africa and also reproduce the majority of the documented regional responses to ENSO and IOD forcings. At the same time the analysis showed significant biases in individual models depending on sub-region and season; however, the ensemble mean had better agreement with observation than individual models. The analysis concluded that the multi-model ensemble mean simulates eastern Africa rainfall adequately and could therefore be used for the assessment of future climate projections for the region. The CORDEX RCMs data was obtained from IGAD Climate Prediction and Application Centre (ICPAC) which is the WMO regional climate center for the Greater Horn of Africa. In this study the region of interest was Lower Jubba that is bounded by latitudes 1.5Ë\x9aS - 12.0Ë\x9aN and longitudes 41.0Ë\x9aE - 51.0Ë\x9aE. There IPCC based climate projection reference period were used namely 2030 (sub-period 1), sub-period up to 2050 (sub-period 2), and sub-period up to 2070 (sub-period 3). The study was divided into two major sections namely assessment of Model Skill in Simulating Observed Climate during the period 1961-1990, and the projection of future rainfall and temperature scenarios. Standard methods were adopted to determine the best climate model/s that could be used for the projection of future climate change scenarios for Lower Jubba region of Somalia for the two standard rainfall seasons Gu (April to June) and Deyr (September to November). The temperature simulations were for all standard seasons of the year in Somalia namely December-February (DJF), March-May (MAM), July-August (JJA), and September-November (SON). Standard methods were also adopted to test the spatial and temporal bias of the individual models. The methods used included various time series methods, correlation and regression analysis. Correlation methods examined correlations between the observed and simulated outputs at specific grid point locations. The square of the correlation coefficient is knows as coefficient of determination (r2) which represented the variance of the observed data that could be accounted for by the predicted variable. Regression method attempted to fit the best linear mathematical equation for the observed relationships. The statistical significance of the fitted linear regression trends were examined using graphical approaches as well as the standards statistical test that include the use of Mann-Kendall Rank Statistics. Similar methods have been adopted in many studies in Africa and the world at large . A linear regression trend was investigated by examining the relationship between time (T) and the variable of interest (X), in this case rainfall, using the following equation X(t) is the individual observed seasonal rainfall/temperature during the baseline period 1960-1990, while Y(t) are corresponding values simulated by the individual CORDEX models over the period 1961-1990, c and b are normally the intercept and gradient (slope) of the regression equation. The slope indicates the average rate of change in the dependent variable in each year of the given time period. A positive/negative slope shows an increasing/decreasing trend respectively. The limitation of this method is that it assumes that all linkages between observed and CORDEX models generated models are linear, and the distributions of the observed and predicted records are normal. For non-normal data the study included nonparametric tests namely the Mann-Kendall rank statistics method was used. In the Mann-Kendall analysis data is ranked after being placed in time sequential order. The time series values (X1, X2, X3, X4 â\x80¦, Xn) where X in this case represents rainfall are replaced by their relative ranks (R1, R2, R3, R4 â\x80¦, Rn) (starting from the lowest value up to n). The relative magnitudes of sample data is compared rather than the data values themselves . The equation used is as follows, where S is the Kendall score given a dataset R with a sample size of n values. The Kendall statistics s is given in Equation (2) below based on Kendall, 1938; 1945; 1948 The observed trend is significant if s values in Equation (2) have significance levels equal or less than 0.5. The ensemble model data was used in this study to compute the correlation value r and linear trend lines for each pixel for the individual seasons. The results for both correlation coefficient r value and the slope were mapped for each pixel and season. The results from the assessment of Model Skill in Simulating Observed Climate for the various seasons determined the models and seasons that were projected into the future using CORDEX RCA4.5 models. The three sub-periods used in the projections included the sub-periods up to 2030 (sub-period 1), up to 2050 (sub-period 2), and up to 2070 (sub-period 3). The results from model verification and climate change projections with CORDEX RCA4.5 models are independently highlighted in the following sections. The annual cycle of Gu (AMJ) and Deyr (SON) season rainfall for the baseline period 1960-90 from gridded CHIRPS observations and CORDEX RCMs simulated outputs were compared the study area in order to determine the best ensemble models that can be used for the future climate change rainfall projections. Future projections of temperature were undertaken for all the four standard seasons of the year. Figure 1(a) and Figure 1(b) illustrate the performance of CORDEX RCMs in simulating annual rainfall and temperature cycles over the study area as compared to the CHIRPS data. All of the RCMs capture fairly well the rainfall seasonality in Lower Jubba. Figure 1(a) shows that the north-south rainfall pattern follows the migration of the ITCZ, with associated locations of maximum rainfall being depicted fairly well by the ensemble model. For the study area, the ensemble mean results were found to simulate fairly well the annual rainfall cycle when compared to individual RCM models. In general, the study revealed some fairly good agreement between annual rainfall cycle simulated by ensemble of CORDEX RCMs and the CHIRPS data. The most notable shortcoming in most individual RCMs is the early peak and overestimation of the mean monthly rainfall particularly in the Deyr season (Figure 1(a)). Studies have shown that GCMs tend to overestimate rainfall in the Horn of Africa region during October to December season . IPCC reports have indicated limitation in the extent of skilful rainfall projection due to the nonlinear and chaotic nature of the climate system . Results from the study showed that the ensemble models closely reproduced realistic representation of the observed climate features. Figure 1(b) shows the performance of CORDEX RCMs in simulating the mean surface temperature over Jubaland compared to the observed temperature data. The ensemble model seems to overestimate temperature when compared to the observed data during the hot months of Jan-April while underestimate during July to December, Figure 1(b). The results from the study indicated that the multi-model ensembles outperformed the individual RCM model as shown in Figure 2(a) and Figure 2(b). All of the RCMs however captured fairly well the rainfall seasonality in Lower Jubba, though significant biases can be found in individual models depending on the seasons as seen in Figure 2(a). The model bias for precipitation in each individual model varies from month to month. NOAA, CNRM and MPI and overestimated the rainfall data between August and November while MIROC underestimates the rainfall data in the same period. Figure 2(b) also showed variation in performance of the RCMs from month to month even with the temperature data. ICHEC underestimated the temperatures between January and June, while NOAA underestimated the data between July and December. MOCH and NCC overestimated the data in April. Similar results are from some previous studies for the Multi-model ensemble projections . It observed from the examination of the skill of the individual CORDEX models and ensemble models simulation observed CHIRPS and GEOCLIM data over the period 1961-1990 best during Gu (AMJ) season. Thus projection of future rainfall scenarios was undertaken for only the Gu (AMJ) season. The projections undertaken for temperature were observed for all seasons. It observed from the examination of the skill of the individual CORDEX models and ensemble models simulation observed CHIRPS and GEOCLIM data over the period 1961-1990 best during Gu (AMJ) season. Thus projection of future rainfall scenarios was undertaken for only the Gu (AMJ) season. The projections undertaken for temperature were observed for all seasons. The results for future projections of rainfall and temperature with the CORDEX RCMs are given below for IPCC sub periods of 2030, 2050 and 2070. The simulations of rainfall concentrated on the Gu (April-June) season, where most models showed more realistic simulations of rainfall. The geographical distribution exhibits notable spatial variability in rainfall over Lower Jubba. Badhaadhe district towards the southern coast exhibits the highest amount of rainfall as seen in Table 1. The southern costal region shows the highest projected amount of rainfall in Lower Jubba throughout all three sub-periods as was seen with the historical data published . The patterns of the projected changes in seasonal ensemble mean Gu rainfall for the three sub-periods namely 2030, 2050 and 2070 showed significant variations in the magnitude of the projected seasonal rainfall from place to place, season, sub-periods and scenarios. There is a general increase in rainfall in Lower Jubba from 2030 to 2070. The projected rainfall is however not homogeneous throughout the region with the inland region receiving the least amount of rainfall. Similar results are reported in the Somali NAPA which shows an increase in rainfall in 2050 and 2080 . This is also supported by IPCC studies that project an increase in MAM rainfall in 2050-2100 in most parts of Eastern Africa . North eastern Kenya bordering Lower Jubba is projected to receive an increase in rainfall of 40% relative to the baseline period (1981-2010) by 2100 during its long rain season . Table 1 shows the range of seasonal precipitation from the projected ensemble data for Gu, averaged over the districts in Jubaland, with RCP4.5 scenario for the three sub-periods 2030, 2050 and 2070. The observed trends of the temporal evolution of the projected precipitation over this region are shown in Figures 3(a)-(c). The results show a decreasing trend for the first sub-period Figure 3(a), followed by an increasing trend for the second and third sub-periods Figure 3(b) and Figure 3(c). The trends are however not statistically significant at a 95% confidence level. Despite being statistically insignificant the results are similar to those of studies over the region . For Africa, IPCC projects that almost all countries except South Africa will probably experience a significant reduction in precipitation until 2050 which then increases significantly between 2050 and 2100 corroborating the results displayed in Figures 3(a)-(c). The averaged mean water vapor, evaporation and precipitation are projected to increase globally by 2100 . The use of climate change knowledge, particularly when mainstreamed into planned policies and poverty reduction strategies can provide a starting point for the identification of climate risks at a district, regional and national level. The projected rainfall further shows dominant dry and wet phases of the Gu season in the future (Figure 4), which calls for sustained investment in early warning mechanisms, and water management systems. The spatial representation of the projected rainfall trends showed no homogenous patterns throughout the three study sub periods. While some areas in Lower Jubba are projected to have general decrease in rainfall during the long rain season, other areas were projected to have a general increase in rainfall (Table 2). General increasing trend was however seen throughout Lower Jubba, with different magnitude of the changes. Details of the pattern in the trend in each district can be seen in Table 2. Although the projected rainfall trends were still not statistically significant, the complexity of the observed characteristics of the changes continues to call for further studies and tailored mitigation and adaptation strategies over the region of study. Individual rainfall time series shown in Figure 5 further indicate general dominance of depressed rainfall during the sub period ending in 2030, followed with dominance of positive rainfall anomalies during the last two sub-periods ending in 2050 and 2070. These results signify the need for investment in early warning mechanisms in Lower Jubba. Results on Lower Jubba are similar to projected results for Africa, where the impacts of climate change will be exacerbated by widespread poverty, diseases and high population growth rates, which would intensify the demand for food, water and livestock . The projected recurrence of depressed rainfall for the near future is significant for a country that is already highly vulnerable with high poverty levels across multiple dimensions . Somalia is already experiencing food insecurity, the implication of a further risk to food and water security could pause a threat on security in a struggle for available resources. Furthermore, results from this study have shown that communities in Lower Jubba revert to charcoal production when their livelihoods are threatened, the impact of which is forest degradation. The recurrence of extreme below normal rainfall often associated with drought is also evident, given the communities use of charcoal as an adaptation strategy, an increase in deforestation and degradation can be expected. The projected precipitation presented in this study call for urgency in finding short and mid-term solutions. The increase in above average rainfall associated with floods as seen in Figure 4 by in sub-period 2 (2050) is also consistent with Tierney, et al. and IPCC that projects increased precipitation in Africa generally during the same period . The magnitude of the extreme above and below average rainfall for the projected future is not the same as seen in Figure 4. Similar results in the bordering regions in Kenya, project an increase in intensity of rainfall, and extreme rainfall events . The spatial pattern of the projected seasonal ensemble mean surface temperature based on the RCMs are shown for the three sub-periods namely 2030, 2050 and 2070 relative to the baseline period showed general warming at most locations over the three sub periods ending in 2030, 2050 and 2070. Results however show that projected change in temperature will vary from season to season and district to district. Like the observed GISTEMP data, the average temperature seems to increase towards the southern costal band in all seasons, possibly due to influence by Indian Ocean . The ensemble models however seemed to overestimate the temperature in JJA which according to the observed data should register the lowest temperature. Results from the temperature time series (Figure 6) show an increasing temperatures in both the near to long term future. This is in line with global and regional reports that project an increase in the average temperature by 2030 and a further increase by 2050 . Results are statistically significant at 95% confidence level. Changes in temperature and humidity are reportedly linked to increased vector borne diseases and helminthes infections . This will also have far reaching implications on many socio-economic sectors. Figure 5 shows the anomalies in the projected temperature time series. Results are similar to IPCC reports projecting more hot and fewer cold temperature extremes in most places as global mean temperatures increase in a seasonal time scale. Results showed the rate of increase in temperature by 0.3 to 0.7 degrees by 2035. The unique patterns of the temperature time series is the tendencies for the annual temperature extremes to be generally higher that the preceding years. WMO recent observations have shown such tendencies in the recent years for the annual mean temperature time series. In general, the projections for Lower Jubba indicated an increase in minimum and maximum temperatures in all seasons in the projection periods 2030, 2050 and 2070. Temperature projections are critical in the development of effective and realistic climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction strategies. The impact of an increasing temperature would be far reaching for most socio-economic sectors including community safety, water, food, energy, infrastructure, among others . The projected temperature would also exacerbate health issues with heat related morbidity and mortality in Africa being projected to increase . Studies have also projected that the geographical distribution of disease prone areas like Malaria will increase as climatic conditions change, creating more conducive conditions for new diseases to breed in areas that were previously disease free . Projected rainfall change patterns indicated significant increase in high rainfall extremes were exhibited in periods leading up to 2050 and 2070. In the case of temperature, the projections from all the models showed increase in minimum and maximum temperatures in all seasons and sub periods, like being observed temperature projection over other parts of the world. Most of livelihoods and the socio-economic activities in Somalia are dependent on water availability from rainfall. The 2030, 2050 and 2070 projected rainfall and temperature change scenarios show that Somalia future development and livelihoods in future will face increased threats of climate extremes unless effective climate smart adaptation systems form integral components of national development strategies. With the prolonging socio economic stability in the country, the development of the required community based effective climate smart adaptation systems will require support from global and regional partners. Efforts to achieve food security in Somalia have long been hampered by climate extremes such as floods and drought, as well as civil wars, political volatility, rapid population growth, among other miseries . Most of the socio-economic activities in Lower Jubba are rain dependent. Recurring drought and floods cause acute stress on a developing economy such as that of Lower Jubba. Flooding in Lower Jubba has been linked to RVF outbreaks which in the past has resulted in a ban in the export of livestock from Somalia and led to massive losses for communities and the Somali economy . Rainfall variability, particularly the projected recurrence of below average extremes in the near future would also impact the rate of restoration of disturbed vegetation. Temperature anomalies indicate recurrences of positive anomalies within all the three projected periods except for OND where some negative anomalies were evident during the first projection period. Seasonal differences, in the observed temperature projections, were quite evident and are major issues that require more studies in order to develop effective and realistic climate change and disaster risk reduction strategies. Long term adaptation planning by the Jubaland Administration for Lower Jubba must take an integrated approach to both floods and drought for both the near, mid and far future. Investment in early warning systems for daily, monthly, seasonal and inter-annual prediction is critical for any effective adaptation strategy. Timely seasonal forecasts and drought monitoring is essential for drought risk reduction in Lower Jubba where livelihoods are closely intertwined with climate variability. The study further provides some important knowledge on rainfall variability and change over the Lower Jubba region that would contribute to the 6th IPCC assessment report on the state of regional climate change over Africa. The knowledge on the past, present and future rainfall patterns derived from this study is important in the development of any effective disaster risk reduction and climate change strategies of Somalia in supporting sustainable development goals, implementation of the Paris UNFCCC, Sendai disaster risk reduction, among other global, regional, national and community based resilience building frameworks.', 'summary': 'Keywords:  Increasing evidence is able to link climate change to major and minor threats to natural systems, threatening environmental, social and economic development .

Projections for temperature were done for all the standard global climatological seasons namely northern hemisphere summer, winter, autumn and spring seasons that correspond to June to August, December to February, September to November, March to May months. The projections of the future Gu long rain season characteristics was done using the IPCC projected periods of 2030, 2050 and 2070 benchmarks. Lower Jubba is located in the Jubaland state of Somalia  . Jubaland consists of the Gedo, Lower Jubba and Middle Jubba regions, and lies 40 - 60 km east of the Jubba River, stretching from Gedo to the Indian Ocean. The state of Jubaland borders the Garrisa, Wajir and Mandera County of Kenya on the western side. Kismayo, located in Lower Jubba, is the largest city in Jubaland, and the third largest city in Somalia after Mogadishu and Hargesa . Lower Jubba receives about 350 mm rainfall during Gu (AMJ) season and an average of 250 mm Deyr (SON) season. Lower Jubba saw a general decreasing trend in rainfall during the Gu rainfall season, and a general increasing trend in the Deyr rainfall between 1981 to 2015 . The Lower Jubba region has also experienced an increase in occurrence of depressed rainfall usually associated with drought, and a decrease in the frequency of above normal rainfall associated with floods . Studies on the GHA show a decrease of MAM long rains and increase in the OND short rains   . Lower Jubba has seen increasing trends in the minimum, maximum and average temperature , consistent with the results from many recent studies worldwide   . Increase in temperature could also change the ecology of infectious diseases as well as increase temperature related mortality and morbidity of people and livestock   . Climate Change projections for Somalia will be used to derive information regarding the potential increase of the threats of climate extremes on future development and livelihoods. It will also enable the development of effective climate smart adaptation strategies. Details of area of study, data used and methodologies adopted are highlighted in the following sections. Gridded CHIRPS and GeoCLIM observations for the period 1960-90 were used as the baseline observations data. CHIRPS is a global dataset (50Ë\x9aS - 50Ë\x9aN, 180Ë\x9aE - 180Ë\x9aW), 0.05Ë\x9a resolution, 1981 to near-present gridded precipitation time series. CHIRPS data are produced by scientists at the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) Climate Hazard Group (CHG) and the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Earth Resources Observation and Science (EROS) Center. The data was developed to support the United States Agency for International Development Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET). Rainfall Measuring Mission Multi-satellite Precipitation Analysis version 7 (TMPA 3B42 v7) is used to calibrate global Cold Cloud Duration (CCD) rainfall estimates. Details on CHIRPS data and their usability in the region are well documented by ICPAC among many others  . A coordinated set of the 20th and 21st century climate simulations for the Atmosphere Ocean coupled Global Climate Models (AOGCMs) in the Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5) have been contributed to by climate modelling groups from all around the world . Data from the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) Africa framework was used in this study to project scenarios for precipitation in Lower Jubba. The CORDEX program is an initiative by World Climate Research Program (WCRP) of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) that generates high-resolution climate projections (50 km) for climate studies, within the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) timeline and beyond   . CORDEX data used in this study represented precipitation fairly well over the region and thus can be used to inform on adaptation and mitigation strategies     . These climate models describe the coupling of the atmosphere with the land surface, with differing dynamics and physics formulations  . For each experiment the historical runs, forced by observed natural and anthropogenic atmospheric composition, cover the period from 1950-2005. The future projections (2006-2100) are forced with two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP), namely; RCP4.5 (mid-range emissions) and RCP8.5 (high-end emissions) scenarios, which prescribe future atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations and aerosols. Detail on the CORDEX RCMs can be found in Endris  and Nikulin . Endris  evaluated the ability of the CORDEX RCMs in simulating the general characteristics of the climate over Eastern Africa region by analyzing the annual cycle, spatial variability, pattern correlation and root mean square error using a Taylor diagram. The study found that these RCMs reasonably simulate the main features of the rainfall climatology over eastern Africa and also reproduce the majority of the documented regional responses to ENSO and IOD forcings. At the same time the analysis showed significant biases in individual models depending on sub-region and season; however, the ensemble mean had better agreement with observation than individual models. The analysis concluded that the multi-model ensemble mean simulates eastern Africa rainfall adequately and could therefore be used for the assessment of future climate projections for the region. The CORDEX RCMs data was obtained from IGAD Climate Prediction and Application Centre (ICPAC) which is the WMO regional climate center for the Greater Horn of Africa. In this study the region of interest was Lower Jubba that is bounded by latitudes 1.5Ë\x9aS - 12.0Ë\x9aN and longitudes 41.0Ë\x9aE - 51.0Ë\x9aE. There IPCC based climate projection reference period were used namely 2030 (sub-period 1), sub-period up to 2050 (sub-period 2), and sub-period up to 2070 (sub-period 3). The study was divided into two major sections namely assessment of Model Skill in Simulating Observed Climate during the period 1961-1990, and the projection of future rainfall and temperature scenarios. Standard methods were adopted to determine the best climate model/s that could be used for the projection of future climate change scenarios for Lower Jubba region of Somalia for the two standard rainfall seasons Gu (April to June) and Deyr (September to November). The temperature simulations were for all standard seasons of the year in Somalia namely December-February (DJF), March-May (MAM), July-August (JJA), and September-November (SON). Standard methods were also adopted to test the spatial and temporal bias of the individual models. The methods used included various time series methods, correlation and regression analysis. Correlation methods examined correlations between the observed and simulated outputs at specific grid point locations. The square of the correlation coefficient is knows as coefficient of determination (r2) which represented the variance of the observed data that could be accounted for by the predicted variable. Regression method attempted to fit the best linear mathematical equation for the observed relationships. The statistical significance of the fitted linear regression trends were examined using graphical approaches as well as the standards statistical test that include the use of Mann-Kendall Rank Statistics. Similar methods have been adopted in many studies in Africa and the world at large       . A linear regression trend was investigated by examining the relationship between time (T) and the variable of interest (X), in this case rainfall, using the following equation X(t) is the individual observed seasonal rainfall/temperature during the baseline period 1960-1990, while Y(t) are corresponding values simulated by the individual CORDEX models over the period 1961-1990, c and b are normally the intercept and gradient (slope) of the regression equation. The slope indicates the average rate of change in the dependent variable in each year of the given time period. A positive/negative slope shows an increasing/decreasing trend respectively. The limitation of this method is that it assumes that all linkages between observed and CORDEX models generated models are linear, and the distributions of the observed and predicted records are normal. For non-normal data the study included nonparametric tests namely the Mann-Kendall rank statistics method was used. In the Mann-Kendall analysis data is ranked after being placed in time sequential order. The time series values (X1, X2, X3, X4 â\x80¦, Xn) where X in this case represents rainfall are replaced by their relative ranks (R1, R2, R3, R4 â\x80¦, Rn) (starting from the lowest value up to n). The relative magnitudes of sample data is compared rather than the data values themselves   . The equation used is as follows, where S is the Kendall score given a dataset R with a sample size of n values. The Kendall statistics s is given in Equation (2) below based on Kendall, 1938; 1945; 1948 The observed trend is significant if s values in Equation (2) have significance levels equal or less than 0.5. The ensemble model data was used in this study to compute the correlation value r and linear trend lines for each pixel for the individual seasons. The results for both correlation coefficient r value and the slope were mapped for each pixel and season. The results from the assessment of Model Skill in Simulating Observed Climate for the various seasons determined the models and seasons that were projected into the future using CORDEX RCA4.5 models. The three sub-periods used in the projections included the sub-periods up to 2030 (sub-period 1), up to 2050 (sub-period 2), and up to 2070 (sub-period 3). The results from model verification and climate change projections with CORDEX RCA4.5 models are independently highlighted in the following sections. The annual cycle of Gu (AMJ) and Deyr (SON) season rainfall for the baseline period 1960-90 from gridded CHIRPS observations and CORDEX RCMs simulated outputs were compared the study area in order to determine the best ensemble models that can be used for the future climate change rainfall projections. Future projections of temperature were undertaken for all the four standard seasons of the year. Figure 1(a) and Figure 1(b) illustrate the performance of CORDEX RCMs in simulating annual rainfall and temperature cycles over the study area as compared to the CHIRPS data. All of the RCMs capture fairly well the rainfall seasonality in Lower Jubba. Figure 1(a) shows that the north-south rainfall pattern follows the migration of the ITCZ, with associated locations of maximum rainfall being depicted fairly well by the ensemble model. For the study area, the ensemble mean results were found to simulate fairly well the annual rainfall cycle when compared to individual RCM models. In general, the study revealed some fairly good agreement between annual rainfall cycle simulated by ensemble of CORDEX RCMs and the CHIRPS data. The most notable shortcoming in most individual RCMs is the early peak and overestimation of the mean monthly rainfall particularly in the Deyr season (Figure 1(a)). Studies have shown that GCMs tend to overestimate rainfall in the Horn of Africa region during October to December season  . IPCC reports have indicated limitation in the extent of skilful rainfall projection due to the nonlinear and chaotic nature of the climate system . Results from the study showed that the ensemble models closely reproduced realistic representation of the observed climate features. Figure 1(b) shows the performance of CORDEX RCMs in simulating the mean surface temperature over Jubaland compared to the observed temperature data. The ensemble model seems to overestimate temperature when compared to the observed data during the hot months of Jan-April while underestimate during July to December, Figure 1(b). The results from the study indicated that the multi-model ensembles outperformed the individual RCM model as shown in Figure 2(a) and Figure 2(b). All of the RCMs however captured fairly well the rainfall seasonality in Lower Jubba, though significant biases can be found in individual models depending on the seasons as seen in Figure 2(a). The model bias for precipitation in each individual model varies from month to month. NOAA, CNRM and MPI and overestimated the rainfall data between August and November while MIROC underestimates the rainfall data in the same period. Figure 2(b) also showed variation in performance of the RCMs from month to month even with the temperature data. ICHEC underestimated the temperatures between January and June, while NOAA underestimated the data between July and December. MOCH and NCC overestimated the data in April. Similar results are from some previous studies for the Multi-model ensemble projections    . It observed from the examination of the skill of the individual CORDEX models and ensemble models simulation observed CHIRPS and GEOCLIM data over the period 1961-1990 best during Gu (AMJ) season. Thus projection of future rainfall scenarios was undertaken for only the Gu (AMJ) season. The projections undertaken for temperature were observed for all seasons. It observed from the examination of the skill of the individual CORDEX models and ensemble models simulation observed CHIRPS and GEOCLIM data over the period 1961-1990 best during Gu (AMJ) season. Thus projection of future rainfall scenarios was undertaken for only the Gu (AMJ) season. The projections undertaken for temperature were observed for all seasons. The results for future projections of rainfall and temperature with the CORDEX RCMs are given below for IPCC sub periods of 2030, 2050 and 2070. The simulations of rainfall concentrated on the Gu (April-June) season, where most models showed more realistic simulations of rainfall. The geographical distribution exhibits notable spatial variability in rainfall over Lower Jubba. Badhaadhe district towards the southern coast exhibits the highest amount of rainfall as seen in Table 1. The southern costal region shows the highest projected amount of rainfall in Lower Jubba throughout all three sub-periods as was seen with the historical data published . The patterns of the projected changes in seasonal ensemble mean Gu rainfall for the three sub-periods namely 2030, 2050 and 2070 showed significant variations in the magnitude of the projected seasonal rainfall from place to place, season, sub-periods and scenarios. There is a general increase in rainfall in Lower Jubba from 2030 to 2070. The projected rainfall is however not homogeneous throughout the region with the inland region receiving the least amount of rainfall. Similar results are reported in the Somali NAPA which shows an increase in rainfall in 2050 and 2080 . This is also supported by IPCC studies that project an increase in MAM rainfall in 2050-2100 in most parts of Eastern Africa . North eastern Kenya bordering Lower Jubba is projected to receive an increase in rainfall of 40% relative to the baseline period (1981-2010) by 2100 during its long rain season . Table 1 shows the range of seasonal precipitation from the projected ensemble data for Gu, averaged over the districts in Jubaland, with RCP4.5 scenario for the three sub-periods 2030, 2050 and 2070. The observed trends of the temporal evolution of the projected precipitation over this region are shown in Figures 3(a)-(c). The results show a decreasing trend for the first sub-period Figure 3(a), followed by an increasing trend for the second and third sub-periods Figure 3(b) and Figure 3(c). The trends are however not statistically significant at a 95% confidence level. Despite being statistically insignificant the results are similar to those of studies over the region   . For Africa, IPCC projects that almost all countries except South Africa will probably experience a significant reduction in precipitation until 2050 which then increases significantly between 2050 and 2100  corroborating the results displayed in Figures 3(a)-(c). The averaged mean water vapor, evaporation and precipitation are projected to increase globally by 2100  . The use of climate change knowledge, particularly when mainstreamed into planned policies and poverty reduction strategies can provide a starting point for the identification of climate risks at a district, regional and national level. The projected rainfall further shows dominant dry and wet phases of the Gu season in the future (Figure 4), which calls for sustained investment in early warning mechanisms, and water management systems. The spatial representation of the projected rainfall trends showed no homogenous patterns throughout the three study sub periods. While some areas in Lower Jubba are projected to have general decrease in rainfall during the long rain season, other areas were projected to have a general increase in rainfall (Table 2). General increasing trend was however seen throughout Lower Jubba, with different magnitude of the changes. Details of the pattern in the trend in each district can be seen in Table 2. Although the projected rainfall trends were still not statistically significant, the complexity of the observed characteristics of the changes continues to call for further studies and tailored mitigation and adaptation strategies over the region of study. Individual rainfall time series shown in Figure 5 further indicate general dominance of depressed rainfall during the sub period ending in 2030, followed with dominance of positive rainfall anomalies during the last two sub-periods ending in 2050 and 2070. These results signify the need for investment in early warning mechanisms in Lower Jubba. Results on Lower Jubba are similar to projected results for Africa, where the impacts of climate change will be exacerbated by widespread poverty, diseases and high population growth rates, which would intensify the demand for food, water and livestock  . The projected recurrence of depressed rainfall for the near future is significant for a country that is already highly vulnerable with high poverty levels across multiple dimensions . Somalia is already experiencing food insecurity, the implication of a further risk to food and water security could pause a threat on security in a struggle for available resources. Furthermore, results from this study have shown that communities in Lower Jubba revert to charcoal production when their livelihoods are threatened, the impact of which is forest degradation. The recurrence of extreme below normal rainfall often associated with drought is also evident, given the communities use of charcoal as an adaptation strategy, an increase in deforestation and degradation can be expected. The projected precipitation presented in this study call for urgency in finding short and mid-term solutions. The increase in above average rainfall associated with floods as seen in Figure 4 by in sub-period 2 (2050) is also consistent with Tierney, et al. and IPCC that projects increased precipitation in Africa generally during the same period   . The magnitude of the extreme above and below average rainfall for the projected future is not the same as seen in Figure 4. Similar results in the bordering regions in Kenya, project an increase in intensity of rainfall, and extreme rainfall events . The spatial pattern of the projected seasonal ensemble mean surface temperature based on the RCMs are shown for the three sub-periods namely 2030, 2050 and 2070 relative to the baseline period showed general warming at most locations over the three sub periods ending in 2030, 2050 and 2070. Results however show that projected change in temperature will vary from season to season and district to district. Like the observed GISTEMP data , the average temperature seems to increase towards the southern costal band in all seasons, possibly due to influence by Indian Ocean . The ensemble models however seemed to overestimate the temperature in JJA which according to the observed data  should register the lowest temperature. Results from the temperature time series (Figure 6) show an increasing temperatures in both the near to long term future. This is in line with global and regional reports that project an increase in the average temperature by 2030 and a further increase by 2050     . Results are statistically significant at 95% confidence level. Changes in temperature and humidity are reportedly linked to increased vector borne diseases and helminthes infections . This will also have far reaching implications on many socio-economic sectors. Figure 5 shows the anomalies in the projected temperature time series. Results are similar to IPCC  reports projecting more hot and fewer cold temperature extremes in most places as global mean temperatures increase in a seasonal time scale. Results showed the rate of increase in temperature by 0.3 to 0.7 degrees by 2035. The unique patterns of the temperature time series is the tendencies for the annual temperature extremes to be generally higher that the preceding years. WMO recent observations have shown such tendencies in the recent years for the annual mean temperature time series. In general, the projections for Lower Jubba indicated an increase in minimum and maximum temperatures in all seasons in the projection periods 2030, 2050 and 2070. Temperature projections are critical in the development of effective and realistic climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction strategies. The impact of an increasing temperature would be far reaching for most socio-economic sectors including community safety, water, food, energy, infrastructure, among others   . The projected temperature would also exacerbate health issues with heat related morbidity and mortality in Africa being projected to increase     . Studies have also projected that the geographical distribution of disease prone areas like Malaria will increase as climatic conditions change, creating more conducive conditions for new diseases to breed in areas that were previously disease free    . Projected rainfall change patterns indicated significant increase in high rainfall extremes were exhibited in periods leading up to 2050 and 2070. In the case of temperature, the projections from all the models showed increase in minimum and maximum temperatures in all seasons and sub periods, like being observed temperature projection over other parts of the world. Most of livelihoods and the socio-economic activities in Somalia are dependent on water availability from rainfall. The 2030, 2050 and 2070 projected rainfall and temperature change scenarios show that Somalia future development and livelihoods in future will face increased threats of climate extremes unless effective climate smart adaptation systems form integral components of national development strategies. With the prolonging socio economic stability in the country, the development of the required community based effective climate smart adaptation systems will require support from global and regional partners. Efforts to achieve food security in Somalia have long been hampered by climate extremes such as floods and drought, as well as civil wars, political volatility, rapid population growth, among other miseries    . Most of the socio-economic activities in Lower Jubba are rain dependent. Recurring drought and floods cause acute stress on a developing economy such as that of Lower Jubba. Flooding in Lower Jubba has been linked to RVF outbreaks which in the past has resulted in a ban in the export of livestock from Somalia and led to massive losses for communities and the Somali economy   . Rainfall variability, particularly the projected recurrence of below average extremes in the near future would also impact the rate of restoration of disturbed vegetation. Temperature anomalies indicate recurrences of positive anomalies within all the three projected periods except for OND where some negative anomalies were evident during the first projection period. Seasonal differences, in the observed temperature projections, were quite evident and are major issues that require more studies in order to develop effective and realistic climate change and disaster risk reduction strategies. Long term adaptation planning by the Jubaland Administration for Lower Jubba must take an integrated approach to both floods and drought for both the near, mid and far future. Investment in early warning systems for daily, monthly, seasonal and inter-annual prediction is critical for any effective adaptation strategy. Timely seasonal forecasts and drought monitoring is essential for drought risk reduction in Lower Jubba where livelihoods are closely intertwined with climate variability. The study further provides some important knowledge on rainfall variability and change over the Lower Jubba region that would contribute to the 6th IPCC assessment report on the state of regional climate change over Africa. The knowledge on the past, present and future rainfall patterns derived from this study is important in the development of any effective disaster risk reduction and climate change strategies of Somalia in supporting sustainable development goals, implementation of the Paris UNFCCC, Sendai disaster risk reduction, among other global, regional, national and community based resilience building frameworks.', 'summary': 'Keywords:  Increasing evidence is able to link climate change to major and minor threats to natural systems, threatening environmental, social and economic development  .

In Sub-Saharan Africa, vulnerability to climate change for local communities is increased because of their dependence on rain fed agriculture    . Large populations in Somalia in particular have experienced severer impacts due to water stress as their livelihoods are dependent on access to water and pasture  . 94% of nomadic populations in Somalia are reportedly living in poverty. Somaliaâ\x80\x99s long coastal line provides fishing livelihood systems threatened by unique marine systems that include Somalia ocean currents systems, tropical cyclones and before tropical cyclones. Somalia has seen an increase in frequency and intensity of floods and droughts with severe droughts in 2007/2008, 2011/2012, 2015/16/17 . Climate induced displacement in Somalia continues to increase with UN listing the number of internally displaced persons due to drought between November 2016 and October 2017 at 943,000 . Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (2015-2030) recognized the difficulty in achieving sustainable development without the development of climate smart systems. Climate change impacts are projected to slow down economic growth, making poverty reduction even more difficult, while prolonging existing poverty traps . Climate change risks undermine the sustainability of basic livelihoods, threatening food security, health among other socio-economic impacts. Without proper adaptation measures, the projected increase in frequency and severity of weather and climate extremes will undermine the safety of ecosystems and health     . The need to strengthen Somaliaâ\x80\x99s capacity to deal with disasters, such as the protracted droughts and floods that it continues to face, is critical . The study attempted to provide projected rainfall and temperature change scenarios for Lower Jubba region, Somalia. This was done using the downscaled Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) RCMs data. The annual rainfall and temperature cycles simulated by an ensemble of CORDEX RCMs were compared with the observed data. The analysis focused on the Gu long rain season, which had the best agreement in comparison to the observed rainfall data. Projections for temperature were done for all the standard global climatological seasons namely northern hemisphere summer, winter, autumn and spring seasons that correspond to June to August, December to February, September to November, March to May months. The projections of the future Gu long rain season characteristics was done using the IPCC projected periods of 2030, 2050 and 2070 benchmarks. Lower Jubba is located in the Jubaland state of Somalia  . Jubaland consists of the Gedo, Lower Jubba and Middle Jubba regions, and lies 40 - 60 km east of the Jubba River, stretching from Gedo to the Indian Ocean. The state of Jubaland borders the Garrisa, Wajir and Mandera County of Kenya on the western side. Kismayo, located in Lower Jubba, is the largest city in Jubaland, and the third largest city in Somalia after Mogadishu and Hargesa . Lower Jubba receives about 350 mm rainfall during Gu (AMJ) season and an average of 250 mm Deyr (SON) season. Lower Jubba saw a general decreasing trend in rainfall during the Gu rainfall season, and a general increasing trend in the Deyr rainfall between 1981 to 2015 . The Lower Jubba region has also experienced an increase in occurrence of depressed rainfall usually associated with drought, and a decrease in the frequency of above normal rainfall associated with floods . Studies on the GHA show a decrease of MAM long rains and increase in the OND short rains   . Lower Jubba has seen increasing trends in the minimum, maximum and average temperature , consistent with the results from many recent studies worldwide   . Increase in temperature could also change the ecology of infectious diseases as well as increase temperature related mortality and morbidity of people and livestock   . Climate Change projections for Somalia will be used to derive information regarding the potential increase of the threats of climate extremes on future development and livelihoods. It will also enable the development of effective climate smart adaptation strategies. Details of area of study, data used and methodologies adopted are highlighted in the following sections. Gridded CHIRPS and GeoCLIM observations for the period 1960-90 were used as the baseline observations data. CHIRPS is a global dataset (50Ë\x9aS - 50Ë\x9aN, 180Ë\x9aE - 180Ë\x9aW), 0.05Ë\x9a resolution, 1981 to near-present gridded precipitation time series. CHIRPS data are produced by scientists at the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) Climate Hazard Group (CHG) and the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Earth Resources Observation and Science (EROS) Center. The data was developed to support the United States Agency for International Development Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET). Rainfall Measuring Mission Multi-satellite Precipitation Analysis version 7 (TMPA 3B42 v7) is used to calibrate global Cold Cloud Duration (CCD) rainfall estimates. Details on CHIRPS data and their usability in the region are well documented by ICPAC among many others  . A coordinated set of the 20th and 21st century climate simulations for the Atmosphere Ocean coupled Global Climate Models (AOGCMs) in the Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5) have been contributed to by climate modelling groups from all around the world . Data from the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) Africa framework was used in this study to project scenarios for precipitation in Lower Jubba. The CORDEX program is an initiative by World Climate Research Program (WCRP) of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) that generates high-resolution climate projections (50 km) for climate studies, within the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) timeline and beyond   . CORDEX data used in this study represented precipitation fairly well over the region and thus can be used to inform on adaptation and mitigation strategies     . These climate models describe the coupling of the atmosphere with the land surface, with differing dynamics and physics formulations  . For each experiment the historical runs, forced by observed natural and anthropogenic atmospheric composition, cover the period from 1950-2005. The future projections (2006-2100) are forced with two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP), namely; RCP4.5 (mid-range emissions) and RCP8.5 (high-end emissions) scenarios, which prescribe future atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations and aerosols. Detail on the CORDEX RCMs can be found in Endris  and Nikulin . Endris  evaluated the ability of the CORDEX RCMs in simulating the general characteristics of the climate over Eastern Africa region by analyzing the annual cycle, spatial variability, pattern correlation and root mean square error using a Taylor diagram. The study found that these RCMs reasonably simulate the main features of the rainfall climatology over eastern Africa and also reproduce the majority of the documented regional responses to ENSO and IOD forcings. At the same time the analysis showed significant biases in individual models depending on sub-region and season; however, the ensemble mean had better agreement with observation than individual models. The analysis concluded that the multi-model ensemble mean simulates eastern Africa rainfall adequately and could therefore be used for the assessment of future climate projections for the region. The CORDEX RCMs data was obtained from IGAD Climate Prediction and Application Centre (ICPAC) which is the WMO regional climate center for the Greater Horn of Africa. In this study the region of interest was Lower Jubba that is bounded by latitudes 1.5Ë\x9aS - 12.0Ë\x9aN and longitudes 41.0Ë\x9aE - 51.0Ë\x9aE. There IPCC based climate projection reference period were used namely 2030 (sub-period 1), sub-period up to 2050 (sub-period 2), and sub-period up to 2070 (sub-period 3). The study was divided into two major sections namely assessment of Model Skill in Simulating Observed Climate during the period 1961-1990, and the projection of future rainfall and temperature scenarios. Standard methods were adopted to determine the best climate model/s that could be used for the projection of future climate change scenarios for Lower Jubba region of Somalia for the two standard rainfall seasons Gu (April to June) and Deyr (September to November). The temperature simulations were for all standard seasons of the year in Somalia namely December-February (DJF), March-May (MAM), July-August (JJA), and September-November (SON). Standard methods were also adopted to test the spatial and temporal bias of the individual models. The methods used included various time series methods, correlation and regression analysis. Correlation methods examined correlations between the observed and simulated outputs at specific grid point locations. The square of the correlation coefficient is knows as coefficient of determination (r2) which represented the variance of the observed data that could be accounted for by the predicted variable. Regression method attempted to fit the best linear mathematical equation for the observed relationships. The statistical significance of the fitted linear regression trends were examined using graphical approaches as well as the standards statistical test that include the use of Mann-Kendall Rank Statistics. Similar methods have been adopted in many studies in Africa and the world at large       . A linear regression trend was investigated by examining the relationship between time (T) and the variable of interest (X), in this case rainfall, using the following equation X(t) is the individual observed seasonal rainfall/temperature during the baseline period 1960-1990, while Y(t) are corresponding values simulated by the individual CORDEX models over the period 1961-1990, c and b are normally the intercept and gradient (slope) of the regression equation. The slope indicates the average rate of change in the dependent variable in each year of the given time period. A positive/negative slope shows an increasing/decreasing trend respectively. The limitation of this method is that it assumes that all linkages between observed and CORDEX models generated models are linear, and the distributions of the observed and predicted records are normal. For non-normal data the study included nonparametric tests namely the Mann-Kendall rank statistics method was used. In the Mann-Kendall analysis data is ranked after being placed in time sequential order. The time series values (X1, X2, X3, X4 â\x80¦, Xn) where X in this case represents rainfall are replaced by their relative ranks (R1, R2, R3, R4 â\x80¦, Rn) (starting from the lowest value up to n). The relative magnitudes of sample data is compared rather than the data values themselves   . The equation used is as follows, where S is the Kendall score given a dataset R with a sample size of n values. The Kendall statistics s is given in Equation (2) below based on Kendall, 1938; 1945; 1948 The observed trend is significant if s values in Equation (2) have significance levels equal or less than 0.5. The ensemble model data was used in this study to compute the correlation value r and linear trend lines for each pixel for the individual seasons. The results for both correlation coefficient r value and the slope were mapped for each pixel and season. The results from the assessment of Model Skill in Simulating Observed Climate for the various seasons determined the models and seasons that were projected into the future using CORDEX RCA4.5 models. The three sub-periods used in the projections included the sub-periods up to 2030 (sub-period 1), up to 2050 (sub-period 2), and up to 2070 (sub-period 3). The results from model verification and climate change projections with CORDEX RCA4.5 models are independently highlighted in the following sections. The annual cycle of Gu (AMJ) and Deyr (SON) season rainfall for the baseline period 1960-90 from gridded CHIRPS observations and CORDEX RCMs simulated outputs were compared the study area in order to determine the best ensemble models that can be used for the future climate change rainfall projections. Future projections of temperature were undertaken for all the four standard seasons of the year. Figure 1(a) and Figure 1(b) illustrate the performance of CORDEX RCMs in simulating annual rainfall and temperature cycles over the study area as compared to the CHIRPS data. All of the RCMs capture fairly well the rainfall seasonality in Lower Jubba. Figure 1(a) shows that the north-south rainfall pattern follows the migration of the ITCZ, with associated locations of maximum rainfall being depicted fairly well by the ensemble model. For the study area, the ensemble mean results were found to simulate fairly well the annual rainfall cycle when compared to individual RCM models. In general, the study revealed some fairly good agreement between annual rainfall cycle simulated by ensemble of CORDEX RCMs and the CHIRPS data. The most notable shortcoming in most individual RCMs is the early peak and overestimation of the mean monthly rainfall particularly in the Deyr season (Figure 1(a)). Studies have shown that GCMs tend to overestimate rainfall in the Horn of Africa region during October to December season  . IPCC reports have indicated limitation in the extent of skilful rainfall projection due to the nonlinear and chaotic nature of the climate system . Results from the study showed that the ensemble models closely reproduced realistic representation of the observed climate features. Figure 1(b) shows the performance of CORDEX RCMs in simulating the mean surface temperature over Jubaland compared to the observed temperature data. The ensemble model seems to overestimate temperature when compared to the observed data during the hot months of Jan-April while underestimate during July to December, Figure 1(b). The results from the study indicated that the multi-model ensembles outperformed the individual RCM model as shown in Figure 2(a) and Figure 2(b). All of the RCMs however captured fairly well the rainfall seasonality in Lower Jubba, though significant biases can be found in individual models depending on the seasons as seen in Figure 2(a). The model bias for precipitation in each individual model varies from month to month. NOAA, CNRM and MPI and overestimated the rainfall data between August and November while MIROC underestimates the rainfall data in the same period. Figure 2(b) also showed variation in performance of the RCMs from month to month even with the temperature data. ICHEC underestimated the temperatures between January and June, while NOAA underestimated the data between July and December. MOCH and NCC overestimated the data in April. Similar results are from some previous studies for the Multi-model ensemble projections    . It observed from the examination of the skill of the individual CORDEX models and ensemble models simulation observed CHIRPS and GEOCLIM data over the period 1961-1990 best during Gu (AMJ) season. Thus projection of future rainfall scenarios was undertaken for only the Gu (AMJ) season. The projections undertaken for temperature were observed for all seasons. It observed from the examination of the skill of the individual CORDEX models and ensemble models simulation observed CHIRPS and GEOCLIM data over the period 1961-1990 best during Gu (AMJ) season. Thus projection of future rainfall scenarios was undertaken for only the Gu (AMJ) season. The projections undertaken for temperature were observed for all seasons. The results for future projections of rainfall and temperature with the CORDEX RCMs are given below for IPCC sub periods of 2030, 2050 and 2070. The simulations of rainfall concentrated on the Gu (April-June) season, where most models showed more realistic simulations of rainfall. The geographical distribution exhibits notable spatial variability in rainfall over Lower Jubba. Badhaadhe district towards the southern coast exhibits the highest amount of rainfall as seen in Table 1. The southern costal region shows the highest projected amount of rainfall in Lower Jubba throughout all three sub-periods as was seen with the historical data published . The patterns of the projected changes in seasonal ensemble mean Gu rainfall for the three sub-periods namely 2030, 2050 and 2070 showed significant variations in the magnitude of the projected seasonal rainfall from place to place, season, sub-periods and scenarios. There is a general increase in rainfall in Lower Jubba from 2030 to 2070. The projected rainfall is however not homogeneous throughout the region with the inland region receiving the least amount of rainfall. Similar results are reported in the Somali NAPA which shows an increase in rainfall in 2050 and 2080 . This is also supported by IPCC studies that project an increase in MAM rainfall in 2050-2100 in most parts of Eastern Africa . North eastern Kenya bordering Lower Jubba is projected to receive an increase in rainfall of 40% relative to the baseline period (1981-2010) by 2100 during its long rain season . Table 1 shows the range of seasonal precipitation from the projected ensemble data for Gu, averaged over the districts in Jubaland, with RCP4.5 scenario for the three sub-periods 2030, 2050 and 2070. The observed trends of the temporal evolution of the projected precipitation over this region are shown in Figures 3(a)-(c). The results show a decreasing trend for the first sub-period Figure 3(a), followed by an increasing trend for the second and third sub-periods Figure 3(b) and Figure 3(c). The trends are however not statistically significant at a 95% confidence level. Despite being statistically insignificant the results are similar to those of studies over the region   . For Africa, IPCC projects that almost all countries except South Africa will probably experience a significant reduction in precipitation until 2050 which then increases significantly between 2050 and 2100  corroborating the results displayed in Figures 3(a)-(c). The averaged mean water vapor, evaporation and precipitation are projected to increase globally by 2100  . The use of climate change knowledge, particularly when mainstreamed into planned policies and poverty reduction strategies can provide a starting point for the identification of climate risks at a district, regional and national level. The projected rainfall further shows dominant dry and wet phases of the Gu season in the future (Figure 4), which calls for sustained investment in early warning mechanisms, and water management systems. The spatial representation of the projected rainfall trends showed no homogenous patterns throughout the three study sub periods. While some areas in Lower Jubba are projected to have general decrease in rainfall during the long rain season, other areas were projected to have a general increase in rainfall (Table 2). General increasing trend was however seen throughout Lower Jubba, with different magnitude of the changes. Details of the pattern in the trend in each district can be seen in Table 2. Although the projected rainfall trends were still not statistically significant, the complexity of the observed characteristics of the changes continues to call for further studies and tailored mitigation and adaptation strategies over the region of study. Individual rainfall time series shown in Figure 5 further indicate general dominance of depressed rainfall during the sub period ending in 2030, followed with dominance of positive rainfall anomalies during the last two sub-periods ending in 2050 and 2070. These results signify the need for investment in early warning mechanisms in Lower Jubba. Results on Lower Jubba are similar to projected results for Africa, where the impacts of climate change will be exacerbated by widespread poverty, diseases and high population growth rates, which would intensify the demand for food, water and livestock  . The projected recurrence of depressed rainfall for the near future is significant for a country that is already highly vulnerable with high poverty levels across multiple dimensions . Somalia is already experiencing food insecurity, the implication of a further risk to food and water security could pause a threat on security in a struggle for available resources. Furthermore, results from this study have shown that communities in Lower Jubba revert to charcoal production when their livelihoods are threatened, the impact of which is forest degradation. The recurrence of extreme below normal rainfall often associated with drought is also evident, given the communities use of charcoal as an adaptation strategy, an increase in deforestation and degradation can be expected. The projected precipitation presented in this study call for urgency in finding short and mid-term solutions. The increase in above average rainfall associated with floods as seen in Figure 4 by in sub-period 2 (2050) is also consistent with Tierney, et al. and IPCC that projects increased precipitation in Africa generally during the same period   . The magnitude of the extreme above and below average rainfall for the projected future is not the same as seen in Figure 4. Similar results in the bordering regions in Kenya, project an increase in intensity of rainfall, and extreme rainfall events . The spatial pattern of the projected seasonal ensemble mean surface temperature based on the RCMs are shown for the three sub-periods namely 2030, 2050 and 2070 relative to the baseline period showed general warming at most locations over the three sub periods ending in 2030, 2050 and 2070. Results however show that projected change in temperature will vary from season to season and district to district. Like the observed GISTEMP data , the average temperature seems to increase towards the southern costal band in all seasons, possibly due to influence by Indian Ocean . The ensemble models however seemed to overestimate the temperature in JJA which according to the observed data  should register the lowest temperature. Results from the temperature time series (Figure 6) show an increasing temperatures in both the near to long term future. This is in line with global and regional reports that project an increase in the average temperature by 2030 and a further increase by 2050     . Results are statistically significant at 95% confidence level. Changes in temperature and humidity are reportedly linked to increased vector borne diseases and helminthes infections . This will also have far reaching implications on many socio-economic sectors. Figure 5 shows the anomalies in the projected temperature time series. Results are similar to IPCC  reports projecting more hot and fewer cold temperature extremes in most places as global mean temperatures increase in a seasonal time scale. Results showed the rate of increase in temperature by 0.3 to 0.7 degrees by 2035. The unique patterns of the temperature time series is the tendencies for the annual temperature extremes to be generally higher that the preceding years. WMO recent observations have shown such tendencies in the recent years for the annual mean temperature time series. In general, the projections for Lower Jubba indicated an increase in minimum and maximum temperatures in all seasons in the projection periods 2030, 2050 and 2070. Temperature projections are critical in the development of effective and realistic climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction strategies. The impact of an increasing temperature would be far reaching for most socio-economic sectors including community safety, water, food, energy, infrastructure, among others   . The projected temperature would also exacerbate health issues with heat related morbidity and mortality in Africa being projected to increase     . Studies have also projected that the geographical distribution of disease prone areas like Malaria will increase as climatic conditions change, creating more conducive conditions for new diseases to breed in areas that were previously disease free    . Projected rainfall change patterns indicated significant increase in high rainfall extremes were exhibited in periods leading up to 2050 and 2070. In the case of temperature, the projections from all the models showed increase in minimum and maximum temperatures in all seasons and sub periods, like being observed temperature projection over other parts of the world. Most of livelihoods and the socio-economic activities in Somalia are dependent on water availability from rainfall. The 2030, 2050 and 2070 projected rainfall and temperature change scenarios show that Somalia future development and livelihoods in future will face increased threats of climate extremes unless effective climate smart adaptation systems form integral components of national development strategies. With the prolonging socio economic stability in the country, the development of the required community based effective climate smart adaptation systems will require support from global and regional partners. Efforts to achieve food security in Somalia have long been hampered by climate extremes such as floods and drought, as well as civil wars, political volatility, rapid population growth, among other miseries    . Most of the socio-economic activities in Lower Jubba are rain dependent. Recurring drought and floods cause acute stress on a developing economy such as that of Lower Jubba. Flooding in Lower Jubba has been linked to RVF outbreaks which in the past has resulted in a ban in the export of livestock from Somalia and led to massive losses for communities and the Somali economy   . Rainfall variability, particularly the projected recurrence of below average extremes in the near future would also impact the rate of restoration of disturbed vegetation. Temperature anomalies indicate recurrences of positive anomalies within all the three projected periods except for OND where some negative anomalies were evident during the first projection period. Seasonal differences, in the observed temperature projections, were quite evident and are major issues that require more studies in order to develop effective and realistic climate change and disaster risk reduction strategies. Long term adaptation planning by the Jubaland Administration for Lower Jubba must take an integrated approach to both floods and drought for both the near, mid and far future. Investment in early warning systems for daily, monthly, seasonal and inter-annual prediction is critical for any effective adaptation strategy. Timely seasonal forecasts and drought monitoring is essential for drought risk reduction in Lower Jubba where livelihoods are closely intertwined with climate variability. The study further provides some important knowledge on rainfall variability and change over the Lower Jubba region that would contribute to the 6th IPCC assessment report on the state of regional climate change over Africa. The knowledge on the past, present and future rainfall patterns derived from this study is important in the development of any effective disaster risk reduction and climate change strategies of Somalia in supporting sustainable development goals, implementation of the Paris UNFCCC, Sendai disaster risk reduction, among other global, regional, national and community based resilience building frameworks.', 'summary': 'Keywords:  Increasing evidence is able to link climate change to major and minor threats to natural systems, threatening environmental, social and economic development  . Climate change impacts are projected to slow down economic growth, making poverty reduction even more difficult, while prolonging existing poverty traps . Increase in temperature could also change the ecology of infectious diseases as well as increase temperature related mortality and morbidity of people and livestock   . Climate Change projections for Somalia will be used to derive information regarding the potential increase of the threats of climate extremes on future development and livelihoods. Data from the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) Africa framework was used in this study to project scenarios for precipitation in Lower Jubba. At the same time the analysis showed significant biases in individual models depending on sub-region and season; however, the ensemble mean had better agreement with observation than individual models. The analysis concluded that the multi-model ensemble mean simulates eastern Africa rainfall adequately and could therefore be used for the assessment of future climate projections for the region.

In Sub-Saharan Africa, vulnerability to climate change for local communities is increased because of their dependence on rain fed agriculture    . Large populations in Somalia in particular have experienced severer impacts due to water stress as their livelihoods are dependent on access to water and pasture  . 94% of nomadic populations in Somalia are reportedly living in poverty. Somaliaâ\x80\x99s long coastal line provides fishing livelihood systems threatened by unique marine systems that include Somalia ocean currents systems, tropical cyclones and before tropical cyclones. Somalia has seen an increase in frequency and intensity of floods and droughts with severe droughts in 2007/2008, 2011/2012, 2015/16/17 . Climate induced displacement in Somalia continues to increase with UN listing the number of internally displaced persons due to drought between November 2016 and October 2017 at 943,000 . Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (2015-2030) recognized the difficulty in achieving sustainable development without the development of climate smart systems. Climate change impacts are projected to slow down economic growth, making poverty reduction even more difficult, while prolonging existing poverty traps . Climate change risks undermine the sustainability of basic livelihoods, threatening food security, health among other socio-economic impacts. Without proper adaptation measures, the projected increase in frequency and severity of weather and climate extremes will undermine the safety of ecosystems and health     . The need to strengthen Somaliaâ\x80\x99s capacity to deal with disasters, such as the protracted droughts and floods that it continues to face, is critical . The study attempted to provide projected rainfall and temperature change scenarios for Lower Jubba region, Somalia. This was done using the downscaled Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) RCMs data. The annual rainfall and temperature cycles simulated by an ensemble of CORDEX RCMs were compared with the observed data. The analysis focused on the Gu long rain season, which had the best agreement in comparison to the observed rainfall data. Projections for temperature were done for all the standard global climatological seasons namely northern hemisphere summer, winter, autumn and spring seasons that correspond to June to August, December to February, September to November, March to May months. The projections of the future Gu long rain season characteristics was done using the IPCC projected periods of 2030, 2050 and 2070 benchmarks. Lower Jubba is located in the Jubaland state of Somalia  . Jubaland consists of the Gedo, Lower Jubba and Middle Jubba regions, and lies 40 - 60 km east of the Jubba River, stretching from Gedo to the Indian Ocean. The state of Jubaland borders the Garrisa, Wajir and Mandera County of Kenya on the western side. Kismayo, located in Lower Jubba, is the largest city in Jubaland, and the third largest city in Somalia after Mogadishu and Hargesa . Lower Jubba receives about 350 mm rainfall during Gu (AMJ) season and an average of 250 mm Deyr (SON) season. Lower Jubba saw a general decreasing trend in rainfall during the Gu rainfall season, and a general increasing trend in the Deyr rainfall between 1981 to 2015 . The Lower Jubba region has also experienced an increase in occurrence of depressed rainfall usually associated with drought, and a decrease in the frequency of above normal rainfall associated with floods . Studies on the GHA show a decrease of MAM long rains and increase in the OND short rains   . Lower Jubba has seen increasing trends in the minimum, maximum and average temperature , consistent with the results from many recent studies worldwide   . Increase in temperature could also change the ecology of infectious diseases as well as increase temperature related mortality and morbidity of people and livestock   . Climate Change projections for Somalia will be used to derive information regarding the potential increase of the threats of climate extremes on future development and livelihoods. It will also enable the development of effective climate smart adaptation strategies. Details of area of study, data used and methodologies adopted are highlighted in the following sections. Gridded CHIRPS and GeoCLIM observations for the period 1960-90 were used as the baseline observations data. CHIRPS is a global dataset (50Ë\x9aS - 50Ë\x9aN, 180Ë\x9aE - 180Ë\x9aW), 0.05Ë\x9a resolution, 1981 to near-present gridded precipitation time series. CHIRPS data are produced by scientists at the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) Climate Hazard Group (CHG) and the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Earth Resources Observation and Science (EROS) Center. The data was developed to support the United States Agency for International Development Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET). Rainfall Measuring Mission Multi-satellite Precipitation Analysis version 7 (TMPA 3B42 v7) is used to calibrate global Cold Cloud Duration (CCD) rainfall estimates. Details on CHIRPS data and their usability in the region are well documented by ICPAC among many others  . A coordinated set of the 20th and 21st century climate simulations for the Atmosphere Ocean coupled Global Climate Models (AOGCMs) in the Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5) have been contributed to by climate modelling groups from all around the world . Data from the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) Africa framework was used in this study to project scenarios for precipitation in Lower Jubba. The CORDEX program is an initiative by World Climate Research Program (WCRP) of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) that generates high-resolution climate projections (50 km) for climate studies, within the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) timeline and beyond   . CORDEX data used in this study represented precipitation fairly well over the region and thus can be used to inform on adaptation and mitigation strategies     . These climate models describe the coupling of the atmosphere with the land surface, with differing dynamics and physics formulations  . For each experiment the historical runs, forced by observed natural and anthropogenic atmospheric composition, cover the period from 1950-2005. The future projections (2006-2100) are forced with two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP), namely; RCP4.5 (mid-range emissions) and RCP8.5 (high-end emissions) scenarios, which prescribe future atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations and aerosols. Detail on the CORDEX RCMs can be found in Endris  and Nikulin . Endris  evaluated the ability of the CORDEX RCMs in simulating the general characteristics of the climate over Eastern Africa region by analyzing the annual cycle, spatial variability, pattern correlation and root mean square error using a Taylor diagram. The study found that these RCMs reasonably simulate the main features of the rainfall climatology over eastern Africa and also reproduce the majority of the documented regional responses to ENSO and IOD forcings. At the same time the analysis showed significant biases in individual models depending on sub-region and season; however, the ensemble mean had better agreement with observation than individual models. The analysis concluded that the multi-model ensemble mean simulates eastern Africa rainfall adequately and could therefore be used for the assessment of future climate projections for the region. The CORDEX RCMs data was obtained from IGAD Climate Prediction and Application Centre (ICPAC) which is the WMO regional climate center for the Greater Horn of Africa. In this study the region of interest was Lower Jubba that is bounded by latitudes 1.5Ë\x9aS - 12.0Ë\x9aN and longitudes 41.0Ë\x9aE - 51.0Ë\x9aE. There IPCC based climate projection reference period were used namely 2030 (sub-period 1), sub-period up to 2050 (sub-period 2), and sub-period up to 2070 (sub-period 3). The study was divided into two major sections namely assessment of Model Skill in Simulating Observed Climate during the period 1961-1990, and the projection of future rainfall and temperature scenarios. Standard methods were adopted to determine the best climate model/s that could be used for the projection of future climate change scenarios for Lower Jubba region of Somalia for the two standard rainfall seasons Gu (April to June) and Deyr (September to November). The temperature simulations were for all standard seasons of the year in Somalia namely December-February (DJF), March-May (MAM), July-August (JJA), and September-November (SON). Standard methods were also adopted to test the spatial and temporal bias of the individual models. The methods used included various time series methods, correlation and regression analysis. Correlation methods examined correlations between the observed and simulated outputs at specific grid point locations. The square of the correlation coefficient is knows as coefficient of determination (r2) which represented the variance of the observed data that could be accounted for by the predicted variable. Regression method attempted to fit the best linear mathematical equation for the observed relationships. The statistical significance of the fitted linear regression trends were examined using graphical approaches as well as the standards statistical test that include the use of Mann-Kendall Rank Statistics. Similar methods have been adopted in many studies in Africa and the world at large       . A linear regression trend was investigated by examining the relationship between time (T) and the variable of interest (X), in this case rainfall, using the following equation X(t) is the individual observed seasonal rainfall/temperature during the baseline period 1960-1990, while Y(t) are corresponding values simulated by the individual CORDEX models over the period 1961-1990, c and b are normally the intercept and gradient (slope) of the regression equation. The slope indicates the average rate of change in the dependent variable in each year of the given time period. A positive/negative slope shows an increasing/decreasing trend respectively. The limitation of this method is that it assumes that all linkages between observed and CORDEX models generated models are linear, and the distributions of the observed and predicted records are normal. For non-normal data the study included nonparametric tests namely the Mann-Kendall rank statistics method was used. In the Mann-Kendall analysis data is ranked after being placed in time sequential order. The time series values (X1, X2, X3, X4 â\x80¦, Xn) where X in this case represents rainfall are replaced by their relative ranks (R1, R2, R3, R4 â\x80¦, Rn) (starting from the lowest value up to n). The relative magnitudes of sample data is compared rather than the data values themselves   . The equation used is as follows, where S is the Kendall score given a dataset R with a sample size of n values. The Kendall statistics s is given in Equation (2) below based on Kendall, 1938; 1945; 1948 The observed trend is significant if s values in Equation (2) have significance levels equal or less than 0.5. The ensemble model data was used in this study to compute the correlation value r and linear trend lines for each pixel for the individual seasons. The results for both correlation coefficient r value and the slope were mapped for each pixel and season. The results from the assessment of Model Skill in Simulating Observed Climate for the various seasons determined the models and seasons that were projected into the future using CORDEX RCA4.5 models. The three sub-periods used in the projections included the sub-periods up to 2030 (sub-period 1), up to 2050 (sub-period 2), and up to 2070 (sub-period 3). The results from model verification and climate change projections with CORDEX RCA4.5 models are independently highlighted in the following sections. The annual cycle of Gu (AMJ) and Deyr (SON) season rainfall for the baseline period 1960-90 from gridded CHIRPS observations and CORDEX RCMs simulated outputs were compared the study area in order to determine the best ensemble models that can be used for the future climate change rainfall projections. Future projections of temperature were undertaken for all the four standard seasons of the year. Figure 1(a) and Figure 1(b) illustrate the performance of CORDEX RCMs in simulating annual rainfall and temperature cycles over the study area as compared to the CHIRPS data. All of the RCMs capture fairly well the rainfall seasonality in Lower Jubba. Figure 1(a) shows that the north-south rainfall pattern follows the migration of the ITCZ, with associated locations of maximum rainfall being depicted fairly well by the ensemble model. For the study area, the ensemble mean results were found to simulate fairly well the annual rainfall cycle when compared to individual RCM models. In general, the study revealed some fairly good agreement between annual rainfall cycle simulated by ensemble of CORDEX RCMs and the CHIRPS data. The most notable shortcoming in most individual RCMs is the early peak and overestimation of the mean monthly rainfall particularly in the Deyr season (Figure 1(a)). Studies have shown that GCMs tend to overestimate rainfall in the Horn of Africa region during October to December season  . IPCC reports have indicated limitation in the extent of skilful rainfall projection due to the nonlinear and chaotic nature of the climate system . Results from the study showed that the ensemble models closely reproduced realistic representation of the observed climate features. Figure 1(b) shows the performance of CORDEX RCMs in simulating the mean surface temperature over Jubaland compared to the observed temperature data. The ensemble model seems to overestimate temperature when compared to the observed data during the hot months of Jan-April while underestimate during July to December, Figure 1(b). The results from the study indicated that the multi-model ensembles outperformed the individual RCM model as shown in Figure 2(a) and Figure 2(b). All of the RCMs however captured fairly well the rainfall seasonality in Lower Jubba, though significant biases can be found in individual models depending on the seasons as seen in Figure 2(a). The model bias for precipitation in each individual model varies from month to month. NOAA, CNRM and MPI and overestimated the rainfall data between August and November while MIROC underestimates the rainfall data in the same period. Figure 2(b) also showed variation in performance of the RCMs from month to month even with the temperature data. ICHEC underestimated the temperatures between January and June, while NOAA underestimated the data between July and December. MOCH and NCC overestimated the data in April. Similar results are from some previous studies for the Multi-model ensemble projections    . It observed from the examination of the skill of the individual CORDEX models and ensemble models simulation observed CHIRPS and GEOCLIM data over the period 1961-1990 best during Gu (AMJ) season. Thus projection of future rainfall scenarios was undertaken for only the Gu (AMJ) season. The projections undertaken for temperature were observed for all seasons. It observed from the examination of the skill of the individual CORDEX models and ensemble models simulation observed CHIRPS and GEOCLIM data over the period 1961-1990 best during Gu (AMJ) season. Thus projection of future rainfall scenarios was undertaken for only the Gu (AMJ) season. The projections undertaken for temperature were observed for all seasons. The results for future projections of rainfall and temperature with the CORDEX RCMs are given below for IPCC sub periods of 2030, 2050 and 2070. The simulations of rainfall concentrated on the Gu (April-June) season, where most models showed more realistic simulations of rainfall. The geographical distribution exhibits notable spatial variability in rainfall over Lower Jubba. Badhaadhe district towards the southern coast exhibits the highest amount of rainfall as seen in Table 1. The southern costal region shows the highest projected amount of rainfall in Lower Jubba throughout all three sub-periods as was seen with the historical data published . The patterns of the projected changes in seasonal ensemble mean Gu rainfall for the three sub-periods namely 2030, 2050 and 2070 showed significant variations in the magnitude of the projected seasonal rainfall from place to place, season, sub-periods and scenarios. There is a general increase in rainfall in Lower Jubba from 2030 to 2070. The projected rainfall is however not homogeneous throughout the region with the inland region receiving the least amount of rainfall. Similar results are reported in the Somali NAPA which shows an increase in rainfall in 2050 and 2080 . This is also supported by IPCC studies that project an increase in MAM rainfall in 2050-2100 in most parts of Eastern Africa . North eastern Kenya bordering Lower Jubba is projected to receive an increase in rainfall of 40% relative to the baseline period (1981-2010) by 2100 during its long rain season . Table 1 shows the range of seasonal precipitation from the projected ensemble data for Gu, averaged over the districts in Jubaland, with RCP4.5 scenario for the three sub-periods 2030, 2050 and 2070. The observed trends of the temporal evolution of the projected precipitation over this region are shown in Figures 3(a)-(c). The results show a decreasing trend for the first sub-period Figure 3(a), followed by an increasing trend for the second and third sub-periods Figure 3(b) and Figure 3(c). The trends are however not statistically significant at a 95% confidence level. Despite being statistically insignificant the results are similar to those of studies over the region   . For Africa, IPCC projects that almost all countries except South Africa will probably experience a significant reduction in precipitation until 2050 which then increases significantly between 2050 and 2100  corroborating the results displayed in Figures 3(a)-(c). The averaged mean water vapor, evaporation and precipitation are projected to increase globally by 2100  . The use of climate change knowledge, particularly when mainstreamed into planned policies and poverty reduction strategies can provide a starting point for the identification of climate risks at a district, regional and national level. The projected rainfall further shows dominant dry and wet phases of the Gu season in the future (Figure 4), which calls for sustained investment in early warning mechanisms, and water management systems. The spatial representation of the projected rainfall trends showed no homogenous patterns throughout the three study sub periods. While some areas in Lower Jubba are projected to have general decrease in rainfall during the long rain season, other areas were projected to have a general increase in rainfall (Table 2). General increasing trend was however seen throughout Lower Jubba, with different magnitude of the changes. Details of the pattern in the trend in each district can be seen in Table 2. Although the projected rainfall trends were still not statistically significant, the complexity of the observed characteristics of the changes continues to call for further studies and tailored mitigation and adaptation strategies over the region of study. Individual rainfall time series shown in Figure 5 further indicate general dominance of depressed rainfall during the sub period ending in 2030, followed with dominance of positive rainfall anomalies during the last two sub-periods ending in 2050 and 2070. These results signify the need for investment in early warning mechanisms in Lower Jubba. Results on Lower Jubba are similar to projected results for Africa, where the impacts of climate change will be exacerbated by widespread poverty, diseases and high population growth rates, which would intensify the demand for food, water and livestock  . The projected recurrence of depressed rainfall for the near future is significant for a country that is already highly vulnerable with high poverty levels across multiple dimensions . Somalia is already experiencing food insecurity, the implication of a further risk to food and water security could pause a threat on security in a struggle for available resources. Furthermore, results from this study have shown that communities in Lower Jubba revert to charcoal production when their livelihoods are threatened, the impact of which is forest degradation. The recurrence of extreme below normal rainfall often associated with drought is also evident, given the communities use of charcoal as an adaptation strategy, an increase in deforestation and degradation can be expected. The projected precipitation presented in this study call for urgency in finding short and mid-term solutions. The increase in above average rainfall associated with floods as seen in Figure 4 by in sub-period 2 (2050) is also consistent with Tierney, et al. and IPCC that projects increased precipitation in Africa generally during the same period   . The magnitude of the extreme above and below average rainfall for the projected future is not the same as seen in Figure 4. Similar results in the bordering regions in Kenya, project an increase in intensity of rainfall, and extreme rainfall events . The spatial pattern of the projected seasonal ensemble mean surface temperature based on the RCMs are shown for the three sub-periods namely 2030, 2050 and 2070 relative to the baseline period showed general warming at most locations over the three sub periods ending in 2030, 2050 and 2070. Results however show that projected change in temperature will vary from season to season and district to district. Like the observed GISTEMP data , the average temperature seems to increase towards the southern costal band in all seasons, possibly due to influence by Indian Ocean . The ensemble models however seemed to overestimate the temperature in JJA which according to the observed data  should register the lowest temperature. Results from the temperature time series (Figure 6) show an increasing temperatures in both the near to long term future. This is in line with global and regional reports that project an increase in the average temperature by 2030 and a further increase by 2050     . Results are statistically significant at 95% confidence level. Changes in temperature and humidity are reportedly linked to increased vector borne diseases and helminthes infections . This will also have far reaching implications on many socio-economic sectors. Figure 5 shows the anomalies in the projected temperature time series. Results are similar to IPCC  reports projecting more hot and fewer cold temperature extremes in most places as global mean temperatures increase in a seasonal time scale. Results showed the rate of increase in temperature by 0.3 to 0.7 degrees by 2035. The unique patterns of the temperature time series is the tendencies for the annual temperature extremes to be generally higher that the preceding years. WMO recent observations have shown such tendencies in the recent years for the annual mean temperature time series. In general, the projections for Lower Jubba indicated an increase in minimum and maximum temperatures in all seasons in the projection periods 2030, 2050 and 2070. Temperature projections are critical in the development of effective and realistic climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction strategies. The impact of an increasing temperature would be far reaching for most socio-economic sectors including community safety, water, food, energy, infrastructure, among others   . The projected temperature would also exacerbate health issues with heat related morbidity and mortality in Africa being projected to increase     . Studies have also projected that the geographical distribution of disease prone areas like Malaria will increase as climatic conditions change, creating more conducive conditions for new diseases to breed in areas that were previously disease free    . Projected rainfall change patterns indicated significant increase in high rainfall extremes were exhibited in periods leading up to 2050 and 2070. In the case of temperature, the projections from all the models showed increase in minimum and maximum temperatures in all seasons and sub periods, like being observed temperature projection over other parts of the world. Most of livelihoods and the socio-economic activities in Somalia are dependent on water availability from rainfall. The 2030, 2050 and 2070 projected rainfall and temperature change scenarios show that Somalia future development and livelihoods in future will face increased threats of climate extremes unless effective climate smart adaptation systems form integral components of national development strategies. With the prolonging socio economic stability in the country, the development of the required community based effective climate smart adaptation systems will require support from global and regional partners. Efforts to achieve food security in Somalia have long been hampered by climate extremes such as floods and drought, as well as civil wars, political volatility, rapid population growth, among other miseries    . Most of the socio-economic activities in Lower Jubba are rain dependent. Recurring drought and floods cause acute stress on a developing economy such as that of Lower Jubba. Flooding in Lower Jubba has been linked to RVF outbreaks which in the past has resulted in a ban in the export of livestock from Somalia and led to massive losses for communities and the Somali economy   . Rainfall variability, particularly the projected recurrence of below average extremes in the near future would also impact the rate of restoration of disturbed vegetation. Temperature anomalies indicate recurrences of positive anomalies within all the three projected periods except for OND where some negative anomalies were evident during the first projection period. Seasonal differences, in the observed temperature projections, were quite evident and are major issues that require more studies in order to develop effective and realistic climate change and disaster risk reduction strategies. Long term adaptation planning by the Jubaland Administration for Lower Jubba must take an integrated approach to both floods and drought for both the near, mid and far future. Investment in early warning systems for daily, monthly, seasonal and inter-annual prediction is critical for any effective adaptation strategy. Timely seasonal forecasts and drought monitoring is essential for drought risk reduction in Lower Jubba where livelihoods are closely intertwined with climate variability. The study further provides some important knowledge on rainfall variability and change over the Lower Jubba region that would contribute to the 6th IPCC assessment report on the state of regional climate change over Africa. The knowledge on the past, present and future rainfall patterns derived from this study is important in the development of any effective disaster risk reduction and climate change strategies of Somalia in supporting sustainable development goals, implementation of the Paris UNFCCC, Sendai disaster risk reduction, among other global, regional, national and community based resilience building frameworks.', 'summary': 'Keywords:  Increasing evidence is able to link climate change to major and minor threats to natural systems, threatening environmental, social and economic development  . Climate change impacts are projected to slow down economic growth, making poverty reduction even more difficult, while prolonging existing poverty traps . Increase in temperature could also change the ecology of infectious diseases as well as increase temperature related mortality and morbidity of people and livestock   . Climate Change projections for Somalia will be used to derive information regarding the potential increase of the threats of climate extremes on future development and livelihoods. Data from the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) Africa framework was used in this study to project scenarios for precipitation in Lower Jubba. At the same time the analysis showed significant biases in individual models depending on sub-region and season; however, the ensemble mean had better agreement with observation than individual models. The analysis concluded that the multi-model ensemble mean simulates eastern Africa rainfall adequately and could therefore be used for the assessment of future climate projections for the region. The CORDEX RCMs data was obtained from IGAD Climate Prediction and Application Centre (ICPAC) which is the WMO regional climate center for the Greater Horn of Africa. The ensemble model data was used in this study to compute the correlation value r and linear trend lines for each pixel for the individual seasons. The results from model verification and climate change projections with CORDEX RCA4.5 models are independently highlighted in the following sections. Results from the study showed that the ensemble models closely reproduced realistic representation of the observed climate features. Temperature projections are critical in the development of effective and realistic climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction strategies. With the prolonging socio economic stability in the country, the development of the required community based effective climate smart adaptation systems will require support from global and regional partners.'}]-

Subsequent development of econometric methods was mostly carried out in the papers and monographs of Cowles Commission in the 1940â\x80\x99s and 1950â\x80\x99s. The specific nature of dealing with the time series data was taken into account by considering efficient estimation of the coefficients of the model and the serial correlation of the error term  (Malinvaud, 1991). Further extension of time series modeling and estimation came about through a large and influential body of literature in the area of distributed lag analysis. The aim of the distributed lag models was to track the influence of the past on the present. With a few exceptions, none of these methods were derived from economic considerations of moving from one equilibrium to another. With the onset of the â\x80\x9ctime series revolutionâ\x80\x9d discussed below, distributed lags all but disappeared from the literature. None of the large number of macro econometric models published following Klein  (1950) paid any attention to the dynamics of the essentially static models. The end came with the article by Sims  (1980) in which economic theorizing was replaced by current and lagged values of all the variables involved in the so-called VAR modeling. As well as the VAR models, the simultaneous equation models were also replaced by the â\x80\x9cdynamic stochastic general equilibriumâ\x80\x9d (DSGE) models, in which the dynamic nature of economic systems is better represented. In all of the econometric methodology developed up until then, time series analysis was always done within the context of â\x80\x9ceconometricsâ\x80\x9d. The arrival of what has become known as the â\x80\x9ctime series econometric revolutionâ\x80\x9d led to the subcategorization of econometrics, as such. The revolution was triggered by  Engle and Grangerâ\x80\x99s article (1987) and was â\x80\x9csanctifiedâ\x80\x9d by the Nobel prize to the authors in 2003. The award for time series econometrics is of some importance not only because of its timeliness but also because of its acknowledgementâ\x80\x95and approvalâ\x80\x95of the revolutionary impact of time-series econometrics on macro-econometric research. This revolution is based on the contention-not rejected by statistical testsâ\x80\x95that many economic variables have infinite variances, that is, that they grow without limit in time, and that observed relationships among such variables may be purely fictitious. The consoling fact, according to the time-series econometricians, is that while the variables themselves have infinite variances, their linear combination or combinations may well have variances that are finite. The above-mentioned â\x80\x9cdiscoveriesâ\x80\x9d have had a profound effect on macro-econometric research. On one hand the â\x80\x9cgrowth-without-limitâ\x80\x9d nature of economic time series has led to modeling the long term movements of these series as simple functions of time plus a random disturbance, and to the concentration of attention on the fluctuations around the time trend. On the other hand, the variables with infinite variances can be transformed to become stationary (integrated) by differencing over time. We can test for the existence of a stable relationship among them. This is known as cointegration. These cointegrated relationships are then to be explained by economic theory. This is in contrast to the traditional deductive approach in which theory comes first and is followed by testing. The practical and revolutionary impact of the new time series econometrics has been the almost complete abandonment of the simultaneous equation models that describe economies or markets as a system of economic relationships. All that seems to have survived are the vector autoregressive models (VAR) and the method of instrumental variable estimation (IVE). The VAR modeling postulates that the current value of each economic variable is a function of its own lagged values and of the lagged values of all other variables under investigation. The IVE method is a relatively simple method of single-equation estimation when some of the right-hand side explanatory variables are suspected of being endogenously determined. Judging from the number of citations credited to Engle and Granger, and by the profound influence of their work, the award of the Nobel Prize was well deserved. However, when it comes to the value of the time series econometrics for the advancement of economics, some serious questions arise. It is reasonably clear that the time-series approach to macro-econometric research, with its tendency toward mechanistic modeling, is shifting econometrics away from economics. This betrays the presumably still existing aim of the Econometric Society â\x80\x9cto advance economics in relation to mathematics and statisticsâ\x80\x9d. Another very important aspect of time series econometrics is the modeling of trends as simple functions of time and a stochastic disturbance. It certainly seems very strange that all a professionally trained economist can say about the long run movement of GDP is that it moves with time except for random fluctuations around the time trend. Gone is all that one has learned about the GDP consisting of consumption, investment, and other ingredients for which we have well developed theories. The point is well made by  White and Granger 2011, who urge that â\x80\x9c(w)henever possible, we recommend attempting to relate apparent trends to appropriate underlying phenomena, whether economic, demographic, political, legal, technological or physical.â\x80\x9d And as for the finding that certain economic variables move together in a stable relationship, isnâ\x80\x99t it a primary function of an economist to find out not only what is happening, but why it is happening? And not only that, but in the case of more than two variables moving together, there generally exists more than one stable relationship, which then leads to a search for their interpretation. This is in clear contrast with the standard deductive approach in which theories lead to relationships to be tested by observations instead of looking for theories to explain what we happen to observe! There is also some serious problem in the way that time series analysis is presented in text books and in applied research. The standard approach to teaching time series analysis ignores completely the classical econometrics the basic foundation of which is the regression model. A logical way would be to explain which assumptions of the classical regression model are likely to be violated when dealing with non stationary economic time series data. This would then be followed by discussion of the undesirable consequences of this on the properties of the least squares estimators and what to do about it. As it is, there is a complete disassociation between classical econometrics and time series econometrics. A lack of connection between time series analysis and economics as such is even more remarkable. The standard explanation of the long-run path of any economic variable as being purely determined by the passage of time plus a stochastic disturbance, with no reference to economic factors, is â\x80\x9cprimitive beyond wordsâ\x80\x9d  (Kmenta, 2009). The above critique raises the question as to why such movement away from traditional econometrics has been so readily embraced by researchers and sanctified by the Nobel Prize Committee. In my opinion the explanation lies in that while economics has been quite successful in specifying equilibrium relationships among economic variables, there has been little success inâ\x80\x95and not much attention given toâ\x80\x95explaining the movements from one equilibrium to another. In other words, the dynamics of economic relationships has been given a minor role in the economic research agenda, and it is precisely the dynamics of variables that the time series analysts specialize in. The critique of the time series econometrics is based on its attention to dynamics at the expense of economics! If, however, the Nobel Prize award should serve as a wake-up call to economists to explain dynamic movements by theories of adjustment costs, decision making under uncertainty, etc., then the whole profession will at the end benefit. But this would inevitably mean a merger of economics and econometrics, something that in my opinion has long been overdue! JanKmenta,11, (2015) Time Series Econometrics: A Critique.

It involves explaining past observations in order to try to predict those in the future . A time series is a collection of observations measured sequentially through time. These measurements may be made continuously through time or be taken at a discrete set of time points . Inflation as described by  is the persistent increase in the level of consumer prices or persistent decline in the purchasing power of money. Inflation can also be expressed as a situation where the demand for goods and services exceeds their supply in the economy . In reality inflation means that your money can not buy as much as what it could have bought yesterday. In recent years, inflation has become one of the major economic challenges facing most countries in the world especially those in Africa including Tanzania. Inflation is a major focus of economic policy worldwide as described by . Inflation dynamics and evolution can be studied using a stochastic modelling approach that captures the time dependent structure embedded in the time series inflation data. The autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (ARCH) models, with its extension to generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (GARCH) models as introduced by  and  respectively accommodate the dynamics of conditional heteroscedasticity (the changing variance nature of the data). Heteroscedasticity affects the accuracy of forecast confidence limits and thus has to be handled properly by constructing appropriate non-constant variance models . The most common way of measuring inflation is the consumer price index (CPI) over monthly, quarterly or yearly. The inflation rate at time is calculated as where is the current average price level of an economic basket of goods and services; is the average price level of the basket a year ago. Within time series modelling, there are two approaches available for forecasting: the univariate and multivariate. In particular this paper will forecast future values of inflation time series data using the univariate forecasting approach, in which forecasts depend only on present and past values of a single series being forecasted. Let be the mean-corrected return or rate of inflation, be the Gaussian white noise with zero mean and unit variance and be the information set at time given by. Then according to Engle  , the process is ARCH if where is the standard deviation and and the error term is such that with non-negativity condition that and for all The ARCH (1) model is a particular case of the general ARCH model given by with non-negativity condition that and. and are unknown parameters. The ARCH models provide good estimates of the series before it is realized. Let be an observed time series. Then the l-step ahead forecast, for at the origin, denoted by, is taken to be the minimum mean squared error prediction, that is minimizes where is a function of the observations. Then according to  , The forecasts for the series do not provide helpful information. It is therefore more useful to consider the squared returns given by . The l-step ahead forecast for the is given by The obvious possible problem in using the ARCH formulation is that the approach can lead to a highly parametric model if the is large. This necessitates the use of the GARCH model as an extension to the ARCH model. A process is GARCH if where and are polynomials in the backshift operator given by with the restrictions and for and being imposed in order to have the conditional variance remaining positive. Equation (8) can be expressed as The GARCH model does not show autocorrelation in the return series. However the squared returns show autocorrelation even though the returns are not correlated. Writing in terms of yields Let. Then where for and for. Thus the equation of has an autoregressive moving average ARMA representation. In order to find the GARCH process, we consider solving for in Equation (8) and let the variance of be, getting Substituting Equation (12) into the Equation (11) one gets Therefore Multiplying both sides of Equation (14) by and taking expectations we get But and since is a martingale difference, also for Thus the autocovariance of the squared returns for the GARCH model is given by Dividing both sides of Equation (15) by gives the autocorrelation function at as Letting to denote the partial autocorrelation for, Equation (16) can be written as By Equation (17), cuts off after for an ARCH process such that for and for. This is identical to the partial ACF (PACF) for an AR process and decays exponentially . Assuming and are known, the conditional maximum likelihood estimates of the GARCH Model can be obtained by maximizing the conditional log-likelihood given by with and The l-step ahead forecast of the conditional variance in a GARCH model is given by where for is given recursively by This section is dedicated to fitting the GARCH family of models to the Tanzania inflation rate data which we obtained from the Tanzania National Bureau of Statistics. The original data set consist of 168 monthly observations of the Tanzania inflation rates spanning from January 1997 to December 2010 as shown in Table 1. To avoid the difficulties of possible premature convergence we perform a pre-fit analysis. This will lead to selecting the appropriate model that adequately describes the data. In this pre-estimation or pre-fit analysis, data are loaded in the form of a price series, and then converted to a return series (stabilized series). The pre-fit analysis checks the return series for correlation and then quantifies the correlation. Because GARCH modelling assumes a return series, we need to convert inflation data (raw data) to returns. Figure 1 below displays raw data of inflation rate and Figure 2 displays the return series converted from the raw. The returns appear to be quite stable over time and the transformations from Inflation rate data to returns has produced a stationary time series. The GARCH model assumes that return series is a stationary process. This may seem limiting, but the inflation data to return transformation is common and generally guarantees a stable data set for GARCH modelling. According to  any autocorrelations in the series have to be removed before a GARCH model is constructed. This is done by regressing the squares of the series on its past squared values with the number of lags determined by the form of the ACF and PACF. The figures below display the sample autocorrelation function (ACF) of the returns based on the assumption that all autocorrelations are zero beyond lag zero. In Figure 3 and Figure 4, the ACF and PACF provide no indication of the correlation characteristics of the returns. The ACF of squared returns in Figure 5 shows significant correlation and die out slowly. These results indicate that the variance of returns series is conditional on its past history and may change over time. Statistical test for heteroscedasticity is carried out in order to establish the presence of ARCH effects in the data. This is shown in Table 2, Table 3 and Table 4. This is done using Ljung-Box-Pierce and Engleâ\x80\x99s ARCH test (  ).', 'summary': 'Keywords:Time Series, Inflation, Autoregressive The concept of time series is based on the historical observations.

Often, one faces problems of lacking useful features and/or of redundant features, causing poor modeling and prediction performance. For better modeling, we need to include high predictive capability features and exclude low predictive capability or redundant features from the original group of features. Good feature selection can increase the modeling efficiency and is the prerequisite for subsequent works. Hence, identifying a series of representative features has become a central problem. In general, features reduction, consists of feature selection  and feature extraction. The former one tries to find a subset which fit the model best from original features set, while the latter one attempts to transform the original high dimension features space into a low one. The features selection can be further divided into two categories: filters  and wrappers. Time series  is a collection of observations taken sequentially in time, and occurs in many fields, e.g. the stock price in successive minutes , the indoor temperature in successive hours, etc. In this paper, we address feature selection for time series. To this end, many methods of feature selection have been reported in the literature. However, none of them can always produce the good performance. In this regard, we first conduct comparative study of several typical correlation based methods of feature selection, and find that they do not work well for time series though they can work well for static systems. This motivates us to provide better schemes for feature selection. Then, theoretical analysis for linear time series is carried out to show why they fail. Based on these observations, we propose a new correlation-based feature selection method. Our main idea is that the features highly correlated with progressive response while lowly correlated with other features should be selected, and for groups of selected features with similar residuals, the one with a smaller number of features should be selected. For linear and nonlinear time series, the proposed method yields high accuracy in both feature selection and feature rejection. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. The feature selection methods are presented in Section 2. In Section 3, we describe the data sets obtained and simulation designs. The results and discussions are given in Section 4. Finally, conclusions are drawn in Section 5. In linear regression method , suppose that the response is related to the feature in a linear fashion, where are m random variables with uniform distribution on interval, independent of each other, and added into to test for effectiveness of this feature selection method. These equations for all are integrated to form the matrix equation, where It is solved by the linear least squares method  to find weights. We find the maximum absolute value of last weights, The feature is retained in the selected feature group if, or discarded otherwise. Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient  is a measure of the linear dependence of two variables and, giving a value between −1 and 1 inclusive. It is usually estimated by based on a sample of paired data. Similarly to the linear regression method, we add m random variables with uniform distribution on interval, independent of each other, and added into to test for effectiveness of this feature selection method. Linear correlation coefficients between response and each feature are calculated, and the maximum absolute value of the last ones is determined, The feature is retained in the selected feature group if, i.e. is more correlated to the response than the random variables. Otherwise, is discarded. It is well known that the relationships between features and the response could be nonlinear. The linear correlation coefficient captures the linear relation only, and thus is not accurate in the nonlinear case, which calls for nonlinear correlation coefficient method. The simplest nonlinear correlation coefficient is the Spearmans rank correlation coefficient, and it is more appropriate when the data points seem to follow a curve instead of a straight line, and is less sensitive to the effects of outliers. Spearmans rank correlation coefficient is a measure of statistical dependence between 2 variables, and is defined as the Pearson correlation coefficient between the ranked variables. Given raw data points, are ranked with such that the largest value has rank 1, the second largest value rank 2, etc. whereas are similarly ranked with. Spearmans rank correlation coefficient of and is Pearson correlation coefficient calculated from and. The efficient way to calculate Spearmans rank correlation coefficient is to use The feature selection based Spearmans rank correlation coefficient follows its linear counterpart by replacing the linear correlation coefficients by Spearmans rank correlation coefficient. A new algorithm, called â\x80\x9cLocal Learning Based Feature Selection for High Dimensional Data Analysis of feature selectionâ\x80\x9d, was proposed by Sun et al.. Its core idea is that an arbitrarily complicated nonlinear problem can be decomposed into a series of local linear problems based on local learning and then the feature relevance is learned globally. Their method does not make any assumption on the data distribution, and is capable of selecting useful features successfully from a large number of features that are irrelevant. Its flowchart is shown as follows. Input: Data, kernel width, regulation parameter, stop criterion. Output: Feature weights. 1. Initiation: Set 2. Repeat: a) Compute b) Compute and with equations, and c) Solve for through gradient descent using the update rule, d) 3. Until: 4. In this algorithm, is the feature vector, is the label corresponding to, and d() stands for the Manhattan distance of,. The correlation methods mentioned above only consider correlation from features to response. It tends to select redundant features if these features are all highly related to response but they are mutually correlated too. To select a set of features as good and few as possible for learning task, one must take into consideration possible interdependencies between the features as well. As a trade-off between the complexity of the selection process and the quality of the selected feature set, a pair wise selection strategy has been recently suggested. This method assumes that a feature is irrelevant if it is uncorrelated with response, otherwise it is useful, and the feature is redundant if a feature is highly correlated with other features. In this paper, we propose some modifications. Firstly, we use the rank correlation coefficient instead as it can capture nonlinear relation and is computational efficient. Secondly, we compare correlation from real features with those from pure noises, and retain those features only when they are more relevant than noises. Thirdly, we introduce tuning parameters to allow the users to fit to specific situations. Thus, the main idea of this modified method is to check first whether the features are correlated in linear or nonlinear way to each other. If the correlation coefficients between a feature and other features exceed the correlation coefficient between this feature and response by some extent, it means that this feature is not useful, and its information can be gained from high correlated other features. The detailed procedure is as follows1. Initialization: a) Define the feature sets: Set as the original set of features and the selected feature set as empty set. b) Select the first feature: compute the rank correlation coefficient between the feature and the response. Then include the feature with the largest as the first selected feature in and exclude it from. c) Remove noisy features: compute the rank correlation coefficient between noise and the response y, where. Set the default m as 20. Let the standard deviation of these m coefficients be. Take away from, if be in such that, where is the threshold ratio. 2. Search for relevant features, repeat until no feature is produced from (b) below. a) Compute the rank correlation coefficient for each pair of variables with and. b) Select the next feature: choose feature as the one that maximizes, subject to, where is the threshold ratio. Move from into. 3. Output the set as the selected features. It will be seen from our simulation study below that correlation based methods work badly for time series in general. The best one, the 2D-correlation method, is able to reject irrelevant features but unable to select minimum number of relevant features. We will find causes of their failure through theoretical analysis in the next section. Consider autoregressive process with order, which is described by where is a purely random process with zero mean and variance. Assume this process is stationary. Then multiply through (11) by, take expectations, and divide to get where is the correlation coefficients of and. This holds true, independent of the initial condition and variance of. For, (12) becomes It is shown in Figure 1 for. If the 2D-correlation method is applied to the above case, we find that there is low efficiency in selecting useful features. Suppose that the feature with time lag 1, , is selected, features with time lags 2, , and 3, , should be considered in the subsequent steps. For system in (11) with, it follows from (13) and Figure 1 that features, and, have higher correlation with selected feature, , than that with response, , and thus are not selected. In general, it is observed that though, are redundant, each of them have significant correlation with response and their values are not necessarily smaller than those of. Besides, they are not necessarily smaller than their own mutual correlations. Thus, the methods mentioned above fail in general. To overcome the drawbacks in the above correlation methods, we propose the progressive correlation method as follows. Select, if correlation of and decreases significantly with that of and y, no longer solely based on single correlation of with y. Further, we also use the correlation of with when we consider after is selected. In this new method, we favor the feature with least time lags when several features with similar relative correlation coefficients exist. And if several groups of selected features have similar modeling residuals, we favor the one with a smaller number of features. The detailed procedure is as follows1. Initialization: a) Define the feature sets: Set as the original set of features and the selected feature set as empty set. b) Select the first feature: compute the rank correlation coefficient between the feature and response. Then find the features which satisfy and select among themone with the least time lag. Include it in and exclude it from. c) Remove noisy features: compute the rank correlation coefficient between noise and the response, where. Set the default as 20. Let the standard deviation of these coefficients be. Let in be such that, where is the threshold ratio. Take away from. 2. Select feature progressively, repeat until the root mean square error of modelled system stops decreasing or there is no feature in: a) Learn a model with the selected features and response, and calculate the model residual series. b) Calculate rank correlation coefficients with. Then calculate relative correlation coefficients with . c) Select the feature which satisfies with minimal time lag from response as the new selected feature in and exclude it from. d) Update the response with the model residual. 3. Varying to different values, and redo step 1. and 2., several groups of features are selected. For those have similar small modelling residuals, we select the one with smaller number of features and less time lag as final selected features. 4. Output the set as the selected features. For testing feature selection on time series, we construct two dynamic systems. The first one is linear system and described by where is white noise with uniform distribution on interval. Coefficients are set as , and the initial conditions are set to be. Then the equation gives us a stable system and the response is shown in Figure 2. The second system is nonlinear and described by where is white noise with uniform distribution on interval. At last, we set and the initial conditions are set to be. Its response is shown in Figure 3. The model without the last three terms in the right hand side is cited from , which represents some economic model with cycles. As our objective is to predict the system response change based on the past observations, we form the features as and the response for regression as For classification, we define the label for each feature vector from its corresponding response as follows (0% threshold) The data set for learning is thus formed by with the data size equal to. Sometimes, one may be interested in large changes only. Then, one can filter the response with some threshold: a data point in the original data set is kept in the filtered data set for regression if. The other data points are discarded. The size of the filtered data set will thus be usually reduced, depending on the actual response. The filtered data set for classification is obtained by using the same label definition before. Equations (16) to (18) are used to generate the following data sets for both linear and nonlinear systems labeled by The Noise-to-Signal Ratio (NSR) is obtained by In this section, we first the simulation results for 4 existing methods, respectively, and make a comparison. Then, we present results of the proposed methods (2DCorrelation Method and Progressive Correlation Method). Comparisons are made firstly based on the performance for different values of the magnitude of random variables added. After that, normalization is applied to both the feature and response, and performances of the first four methods are then compared in Table 1 to Table 9, respectively. From the results above, we can conclude that the magnitude of random variables added does not have any significant effect on the performance of the 4 methods: linear regression, linear correlation coefficient, rank correlation coefficient, and local learning method. There are some cases when the performance is affected, for example when Spearmans rank correlation method was applied to nonlinear system with NSR = 0.5224 and r = 10, d = 0.01, m = 3, the rejection rate for b = 0.01 is 0.83, for b = 0.1 is 0.67, and for b = 1 is 1. However, in the majority of the cases, the rejection rate and selection rate are about the same. This might be because the random features which were added do not have any correlation with the response, and thus their correlation coefficient with respect to the response is close to 0. When the magnitude of random variables is increased, the correlation coefficient might be increased, but the change is not very big due to the random nature of these variables. Therefore, the threshold level might not have increased by so much, and the performance level is roughly the same. Overall, Dr. Suns method of feature selection based on local learning seems to give the best result. In most cases, it is able to remove at least some, if not the majority of the irrelevant features. However, not all of the relevant features were selected; and it fails altogether in a few cases. Nevertheless, it still gives better result than linear correlation coefficient, rank correlation coefficient, and linear regression, which tends to select most of the features, regardless of whether they are relevant. In the simulation of correlation method, we set the threshold as 1.5 and the parameter as 0.5. In our experiments, it indicates that the magnitude of added random variables do not affect the performance significantly, and is set as fixed one [−1, 1]. The simulation results are shown in Tables 10 and 11. In terms of feature rejection, we observe that the correlation method yields quite positive results. In most of the cases, this method is able to eliminate most of the irre- levant features, with the rate of correctly rejected features almost always higher than 0.5. In some particular situations, the rate of correctly rejected feature stands at 1. This might be because by evaluating the correction coefficient between features, we are able to reduce the number of features that are highly-correlated to each other, and thus feature rejection rate increases. However, there are cases (such as linear data set NSR = 0.8649 with number of features, and the feature threshold level) where correct rejection rate is 0. This might be because is the only irrelevant feature for linear data set, and the number of features were not large enough for the covariance checking to be effective, and hence this irrelevant feature has passed the testing criteria. In terms of feature selection, this method does not give very good results, especially for linear data sets. For most of the test cases for linear data sets, the method is able to select at most 1 feature out of 2 (if) or 3 (if). One possible explanation might be the high correlation coefficient between consecutive feature features. For example, and are consecutive terms in the time series, and hence they are highly correlated. As a result, their correlation coefficient is often higher than the correlation coefficient between the response and feature vector. This weakness should be considered and improve in the extended method. In the simulation of progressive correlation method, we change the response to As both responses come from the same time series, they can be transformed to each other, and either one can be used for feature selection. The threshold is set as 0.1 - 0.8 with step of 0.1, which can give us eight candidate options, and the parameter as 5, which can neglect most noise features. Then we select the final selected features from eight candidate options, and choose the option with smaller response residuals, less number of features as the final selection result. The simulation result is shown in Table 12. From the simulation result, we find this kind of feature selection method yields quite good both in feature selection and feature rejection for data sets with and without noise. For linear data set, the progressive correlation method can accurately select most useful features and reject most irrelevant features for data set without noise. For data set with noise, this method performs better, as it can accurately select all the useful features and rejects most irrelevant features. For nonlinear data set, the progressive correlation method also achieves better results than before. From the result, it can select most useful features and reject most irrelevant features for data sets with no or low NSR. For data set with high noise, it performs a bit worse. But it still can select some useful features and reject all the irrelevant features. This paper has conducted comparative studies of several representative methods for feature selection in the context of time series modeling. A modified correlation method is presented. In most of the cases, this method is able to eliminate most of the irrelevant features. However, it has a poor performance in feature selection, which can only select half of useful features or even less. We show why these methods fail. In order to rectify the causes of failure, we propose the progressive correlation method. It yields the best results, as generally it can remove most irrelevant features and keep most of the relevant features. Further, it works quite consistently in both linear and nonlinear data sets, and over both high and low noisesignal ratio, indicating that it is a robust method, and can work in different conditions. The use of correlation coefficients patterns shown in formula (12) and Figure 1 to select exact number of features is under progress of our research.', 'summary': 'For better modeling, we need to include high predictive capability features and exclude low predictive capability or redundant features from the original group of features.

Other physical systems exhibit disequilibrium movement but due to external factors, the equilibrium state is reached . In mathematics, especially in differential equations, an equilibrium points is an optimal solution to a differential equation. Time optimal control is a method of mathematical optimisation for deriving control policies . Firstly, we will introduce the system of ordinary differential equations  : The Equation (1) introduces the system of ordinary differential equations with an initial state. The is considered to be the state vector. The components are state variables while u is the control vector with control variables presented as. Firstly, u is merely integrable while f is continuously differentiable with respect to so that we can allow for discontinuous changes in its components, the control variables. A control problem that we pose is the following: if we take initial state as when t = 0 what control vector can we choose that will take us to the target state, at time. How can this system be controlled  ? If the cost function is introduced and it is related to control problem, its minimisation by seeking controls u results with an optimal control problem. But we want to have time-optimal control problem. In order to obtain time-optimal control problem, we put and hence so that we seek to minimize the time taken to reach the state. We will study this problem for the relatively simple first order differential linear, constant, coefficient equations: We are going to study a time series graph, one line that is dependent of time and some other variable . We assume that time series graph has an equilibrium position  , it is unstable and it can be moving in infinitely small time up and down. However, irrespectively of the other factors, we assume that time series graph has attained its equilibrium value. We want to find out what kind of external factor can affect it and make it move it out of equilibrium, as it is possible, that the time series graph tends to stay in equilibrium. In order to analyse the following problem, we use the following differential equation: where x represents the deviation from the equilibrium value, it could be called vertical deviation from the equilibrium as the 2D time series can move only up and down. As we assume that time series is in equilibrium, u represents external attempts that make the time series graph stays in equilibrium. If we assume that at, the deviation is existent and is presented like. Can this deviation be controlled and if it can be controlled, how quickly can it be controlled? First case that we will analyse is that there is no attempt to control the deviation with, then the solution of equation is the following: With no external factor affecting the time series graph, it is almost certain that the graph will move out of its equilibrium. The equilibrium with is an unstable equilibrium point. In order to apply general control, we can solve (4) by using the integrating factor, so we have the following  : And hence we have: Since we want to have to analyse the system in equilibrium, we must have when, so we must have: As, u must be negative for at least some period from. If is not bounded below, it is easy to choose u to satisfy, for example with, but however as we can only react in short time as stock price movement follows random walk and exchange rate is changing in infinitely small time intervals, we can control the system in an arbitrarily short time by making sufficiently large. At the same time, there are the systems in economy which control is unbounded, but then time-optimal problem is meaningless. We will take external factors to be in the range of. In order to push x back towards the equilibrium as quickly as possible, we need to push as hard as possible by taking, so we get: The solution is then Equation (10) shows that as as. If then the system cannot be controlled back to equilibrium. Figure 1 demonstrates that the equilibrium can only be achieved when deviation is less than one, then equilibrium can be reached. For the values that are higher than the equilibrium solution cannot be reached. What is important to notice is that if x is above or below 1, the system is out of equilibrium, and as the time passes it diverges more from the equilibrium. We will introduce the controllable set which represents the set of initial states that can be controlled to the origin or equilibrium in some time. This is the union of all the controllable sets at time. The controllable set is given as following  : If C is the whole real line, , we say that the system is completely controllable. Since our system is not the whole real line, it means it is not completely controllable. Now, we must define the reachable set. It is the set where control exists. From Equation (7), we have: and since, we obtain: so that we have: defines the points in the reachable set. For, the reachable set doesnâ\x80\x99t contain the origin and cannot reach the equilibrium. On the other side for, the origin or equilibrium is reachable for In order to make the final assumption and summarise the analysis the following will be stated. If time series graphs exhibit equilibrium state and tend to diverge from the aforementioned equilibrium state, external influence must be exerted via some of the external factors in order to attain equilibrium. This exertion of external influence can only be conducted in infinitely small time interval and must be sufficiently large. If the external influence or factor is unbounded, then optimal time control is not effective and this is what causes big financial disruptions or disruptions in any sense. It is also proved if equilibrium state of time series exhibit maximally one standard deviation, it can be returned to equilibrium state. Deviations larger than one standard deviation cause series to diverge from equilibrium level and to attain new equilibrium. At the same time, even if new financial equilibrium is established, there is still risk of financial disruption and crisis. Unfortunately, when we move away from time optimal control problem, we have to develop a new theory. At the same time, next step concerning the proposed theory is its testing and calibration. This paper tries to introduce an innovative approach in time series analysis pertaining in that sense to time series that are characterized by equilibrium value. It introduces time optimal control problem and proves that the aforementioned time series can keep their equilibrium in case when the deviation is less than one standard deviation and under the condition that external influence is large enough. In case that external influence is too large, easily financial disruption can be caused. If the deviation from equilibrium is bigger than one s.d, it is possible that new equilibrium state is sought or the system doesnâ\x80\x99t know how to behave and that there is a possibility of financial disruption until the state is stabilised again.', 'summary': 'We assume that time series graph has an equilibrium position  , it is unstable and it can be moving in infinitely small time up and down.

Subsequent development of econometric methods was mostly carried out in the papers and monographs of Cowles Commission in the 1940â\x80\x99s and 1950â\x80\x99s. The specific nature of dealing with the time series data was taken into account by considering efficient estimation of the coefficients of the model and the serial correlation of the error term  (Malinvaud, 1991). Further extension of time series modeling and estimation came about through a large and influential body of literature in the area of distributed lag analysis. The aim of the distributed lag models was to track the influence of the past on the present. With a few exceptions, none of these methods were derived from economic considerations of moving from one equilibrium to another. With the onset of the â\x80\x9ctime series revolutionâ\x80\x9d discussed below, distributed lags all but disappeared from the literature. None of the large number of macro econometric models published following Klein  (1950) paid any attention to the dynamics of the essentially static models. The end came with the article by Sims  (1980) in which economic theorizing was replaced by current and lagged values of all the variables involved in the so-called VAR modeling. As well as the VAR models, the simultaneous equation models were also replaced by the â\x80\x9cdynamic stochastic general equilibriumâ\x80\x9d (DSGE) models, in which the dynamic nature of economic systems is better represented. In all of the econometric methodology developed up until then, time series analysis was always done within the context of â\x80\x9ceconometricsâ\x80\x9d. The arrival of what has become known as the â\x80\x9ctime series econometric revolutionâ\x80\x9d led to the subcategorization of econometrics, as such. The revolution was triggered by  Engle and Grangerâ\x80\x99s article (1987) and was â\x80\x9csanctifiedâ\x80\x9d by the Nobel prize to the authors in 2003. The award for time series econometrics is of some importance not only because of its timeliness but also because of its acknowledgementâ\x80\x95and approvalâ\x80\x95of the revolutionary impact of time-series econometrics on macro-econometric research. This revolution is based on the contention-not rejected by statistical testsâ\x80\x95that many economic variables have infinite variances, that is, that they grow without limit in time, and that observed relationships among such variables may be purely fictitious. The consoling fact, according to the time-series econometricians, is that while the variables themselves have infinite variances, their linear combination or combinations may well have variances that are finite. The above-mentioned â\x80\x9cdiscoveriesâ\x80\x9d have had a profound effect on macro-econometric research. On one hand the â\x80\x9cgrowth-without-limitâ\x80\x9d nature of economic time series has led to modeling the long term movements of these series as simple functions of time plus a random disturbance, and to the concentration of attention on the fluctuations around the time trend. On the other hand, the variables with infinite variances can be transformed to become stationary (integrated) by differencing over time. We can test for the existence of a stable relationship among them. This is known as cointegration. These cointegrated relationships are then to be explained by economic theory. This is in contrast to the traditional deductive approach in which theory comes first and is followed by testing. The practical and revolutionary impact of the new time series econometrics has been the almost complete abandonment of the simultaneous equation models that describe economies or markets as a system of economic relationships. All that seems to have survived are the vector autoregressive models (VAR) and the method of instrumental variable estimation (IVE). The VAR modeling postulates that the current value of each economic variable is a function of its own lagged values and of the lagged values of all other variables under investigation. The IVE method is a relatively simple method of single-equation estimation when some of the right-hand side explanatory variables are suspected of being endogenously determined. Judging from the number of citations credited to Engle and Granger, and by the profound influence of their work, the award of the Nobel Prize was well deserved. However, when it comes to the value of the time series econometrics for the advancement of economics, some serious questions arise. It is reasonably clear that the time-series approach to macro-econometric research, with its tendency toward mechanistic modeling, is shifting econometrics away from economics. This betrays the presumably still existing aim of the Econometric Society â\x80\x9cto advance economics in relation to mathematics and statisticsâ\x80\x9d. Another very important aspect of time series econometrics is the modeling of trends as simple functions of time and a stochastic disturbance. It certainly seems very strange that all a professionally trained economist can say about the long run movement of GDP is that it moves with time except for random fluctuations around the time trend. Gone is all that one has learned about the GDP consisting of consumption, investment, and other ingredients for which we have well developed theories. The point is well made by  White and Granger 2011, who urge that â\x80\x9c(w)henever possible, we recommend attempting to relate apparent trends to appropriate underlying phenomena, whether economic, demographic, political, legal, technological or physical.â\x80\x9d And as for the finding that certain economic variables move together in a stable relationship, isnâ\x80\x99t it a primary function of an economist to find out not only what is happening, but why it is happening? And not only that, but in the case of more than two variables moving together, there generally exists more than one stable relationship, which then leads to a search for their interpretation. This is in clear contrast with the standard deductive approach in which theories lead to relationships to be tested by observations instead of looking for theories to explain what we happen to observe! There is also some serious problem in the way that time series analysis is presented in text books and in applied research. The standard approach to teaching time series analysis ignores completely the classical econometrics the basic foundation of which is the regression model. A logical way would be to explain which assumptions of the classical regression model are likely to be violated when dealing with non stationary economic time series data. This would then be followed by discussion of the undesirable consequences of this on the properties of the least squares estimators and what to do about it. As it is, there is a complete disassociation between classical econometrics and time series econometrics. A lack of connection between time series analysis and economics as such is even more remarkable. The standard explanation of the long-run path of any economic variable as being purely determined by the passage of time plus a stochastic disturbance, with no reference to economic factors, is â\x80\x9cprimitive beyond wordsâ\x80\x9d  (Kmenta, 2009). The above critique raises the question as to why such movement away from traditional econometrics has been so readily embraced by researchers and sanctified by the Nobel Prize Committee. In my opinion the explanation lies in that while economics has been quite successful in specifying equilibrium relationships among economic variables, there has been little success inâ\x80\x95and not much attention given toâ\x80\x95explaining the movements from one equilibrium to another. In other words, the dynamics of economic relationships has been given a minor role in the economic research agenda, and it is precisely the dynamics of variables that the time series analysts specialize in. The critique of the time series econometrics is based on its attention to dynamics at the expense of economics! If, however, the Nobel Prize award should serve as a wake-up call to economists to explain dynamic movements by theories of adjustment costs, decision making under uncertainty, etc., then the whole profession will at the end benefit. But this would inevitably mean a merger of economics and econometrics, something that in my opinion has long been overdue! JanKmenta,11, (2015) Time Series Econometrics: A Critique.

None of the large number of macro econometric models published following Klein  (1950) paid any attention to the dynamics of the essentially static models. The consoling fact, according to the time-series econometricians, is that while the variables themselves have infinite variances, their linear combination or combinations may well have variances that are finite. The IVE method is a relatively simple method of single-equation estimation when some of the right-hand side explanatory variables are suspected of being endogenously determined. It is reasonably clear that the time-series approach to macro-econometric research, with its tendency toward mechanistic modeling, is shifting econometrics away from economics. A logical way would be to explain which assumptions of the classical regression model are likely to be violated when dealing with non stationary economic time series data.'}, {'authors': {'Edward Ngailo': 'https://www.scirp.org/journal/articles.aspx?searchCode=Edward+Ngailo&searchField=authors&page=1&SKID=0', 'Eliab Luvanda': 'https://www.scirp.org/journal/articles.aspx?searchCode=Eliab+Luvanda&searchField=authors&page=1&SKID=0', 'Estomih S.

It involves explaining past observations in order to try to predict those in the future . A time series is a collection of observations measured sequentially through time. These measurements may be made continuously through time or be taken at a discrete set of time points . Inflation as described by  is the persistent increase in the level of consumer prices or persistent decline in the purchasing power of money. Inflation can also be expressed as a situation where the demand for goods and services exceeds their supply in the economy . In reality inflation means that your money can not buy as much as what it could have bought yesterday. In recent years, inflation has become one of the major economic challenges facing most countries in the world especially those in Africa including Tanzania. Inflation is a major focus of economic policy worldwide as described by . Inflation dynamics and evolution can be studied using a stochastic modelling approach that captures the time dependent structure embedded in the time series inflation data. The autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (ARCH) models, with its extension to generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (GARCH) models as introduced by  and  respectively accommodate the dynamics of conditional heteroscedasticity (the changing variance nature of the data). Heteroscedasticity affects the accuracy of forecast confidence limits and thus has to be handled properly by constructing appropriate non-constant variance models . The most common way of measuring inflation is the consumer price index (CPI) over monthly, quarterly or yearly. The inflation rate at time is calculated as where is the current average price level of an economic basket of goods and services; is the average price level of the basket a year ago. Within time series modelling, there are two approaches available for forecasting: the univariate and multivariate. In particular this paper will forecast future values of inflation time series data using the univariate forecasting approach, in which forecasts depend only on present and past values of a single series being forecasted. Let be the mean-corrected return or rate of inflation, be the Gaussian white noise with zero mean and unit variance and be the information set at time given by. Then according to Engle  the process is ARCH if where is the standard deviation and and the error term is such that with non-negativity condition that and for all The ARCH (1) model is a particular case of the general ARCH model given by with non-negativity condition that and. and are unknown parameters. The ARCH models provide good estimates of the series before it is realized. Let be an observed time series. Then the l-step ahead forecast, for at the origin, denoted by, is taken to be the minimum mean squared error prediction, that is minimizes where is a function of the observations. Then according to  , The forecasts for the series do not provide helpful information. It is therefore more useful to consider the squared returns given by . The l-step ahead forecast for the is given by The obvious possible problem in using the ARCH formulation is that the approach can lead to a highly parametric model if the is large. This necessitates the use of the GARCH model as an extension to the ARCH model. A process is GARCH if where and are polynomials in the backshift operator given by with the restrictions and for and being imposed in order to have the conditional variance remaining positive. Equation (8) can be expressed as The GARCH model does not show autocorrelation in the return series. However the squared returns show autocorrelation even though the returns are not correlated. Writing in terms of yields Let. Then where for and for. Thus the equation of has an autoregressive moving average ARMA representation. In order to find the GARCH process, we consider solving for in Equation (8) and let the variance of be, getting Substituting Equation (12) into the Equation (11) one gets Therefore Multiplying both sides of Equation (14) by and taking expectations we get But and since is a martingale difference, also for Thus the autocovariance of the squared returns for the GARCH model is given by Dividing both sides of Equation (15) by gives the autocorrelation function at as Letting to denote the partial autocorrelation for, Equation (16) can be written as By Equation (17), cuts off after for an ARCH process such that for and for. This is identical to the partial ACF (PACF) for an AR process and decays exponentially . Assuming and are known, the conditional maximum likelihood estimates of the GARCH Model can be obtained by maximizing the conditional log-likelihood given by with and The l-step ahead forecast of the conditional variance in a GARCH model is given by where for is given recursively by This section is dedicated to fitting the GARCH family of models to the Tanzania inflation rate data which we obtained from the Tanzania National Bureau of Statistics. The original data set consist of 168 monthly observations of the Tanzania inflation rates spanning from January 1997 to December 2010 as shown in Table 1. To avoid the difficulties of possible premature convergence we perform a pre-fit analysis. This will lead to selecting the appropriate model that adequately describes the data. In this pre-estimation or pre-fit analysis, data are loaded in the form of a price series, and then converted to a return series (stabilized series). The pre-fit analysis checks the return series for correlation and then quantifies the correlation. Because GARCH modelling assumes a return series, we need to convert inflation data (raw data) to returns. Figure 1 below displays raw data of inflation rate and Figure 2 displays the return series converted from the raw. The returns appear to be quite stable over time and the transformations from Inflation rate data to returns has produced a stationary time series. The GARCH model assumes that return series is a stationary process. This may seem limiting, but the inflation data to return transformation is common and generally guarantees a stable data set for GARCH modelling. According to  any autocorrelations in the series have to be removed before a GARCH model is constructed. This is done by regressing the squares of the series on its past squared values with the number of lags determined by the form of the ACF and PACF. The figures below display the sample autocorrelation function (ACF) of the returns based on the assumption that all autocorrelations are zero beyond lag zero. In Figure 3 and Figure 4, the ACF and PACF provide no indication of the correlation characteristics of the returns. The ACF of squared returns in Figure 5 shows significant correlation and die out slowly. These results indicate that the variance of returns series is conditional on its past history and may change over time. Statistical test for heteroscedasticity is carried out in order to establish the presence of ARCH effects in the data. This is shown in Table 2, Table 3 and Table 4.

Often, one faces problems of lacking useful features and/or of redundant features, causing poor modeling and prediction performance. For better modeling, we need to include high predictive capability features and exclude low predictive capability or redundant features from the original group of features. Good feature selection can increase the modeling efficiency and is the prerequisite for subsequent works. Hence, identifying a series of representative features has become a central problem. In general, features reduction, consists of feature selection  and feature extraction. The former one tries to find a subset which fit the model best from original features set, while the latter one attempts to transform the original high dimension features space into a low one. The features selection can be further divided into two categories: filters  and wrappers. Time series  is a collection of observations taken sequentially in time, and occurs in many fields, e.g. the stock price in successive minutes the indoor temperature in successive hours, etc. In this paper, we address feature selection for time series. To this end, many methods of feature selection have been reported in the literature. However, none of them can always produce the good performance. In this regard, we first conduct comparative study of several typical correlation based methods of feature selection, and find that they do not work well for time series though they can work well for static systems. This motivates us to provide better schemes for feature selection. Then, theoretical analysis for linear time series is carried out to show why they fail. Based on these observations, we propose a new correlation-based feature selection method. Our main idea is that the features highly correlated with progressive response while lowly correlated with other features should be selected, and for groups of selected features with similar residuals, the one with a smaller number of features should be selected. For linear and nonlinear time series, the proposed method yields high accuracy in both feature selection and feature rejection. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. The feature selection methods are presented in Section 2. In Section 3, we describe the data sets obtained and simulation designs. The results and discussions are given in Section 4. Finally, conclusions are drawn in Section 5. In linear regression method suppose that the response is related to the feature in a linear fashion, where are m random variables with uniform distribution on interval, independent of each other, and added into to test for effectiveness of this feature selection method. These equations for all are integrated to form the matrix equation, where It is solved by the linear least squares method  to find weights. We find the maximum absolute value of last weights, The feature is retained in the selected feature group if, or discarded otherwise. Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient  is a measure of the linear dependence of two variables and, giving a value between −1 and 1 inclusive. It is usually estimated by based on a sample of paired data. Similarly to the linear regression method, we add m random variables with uniform distribution on interval, independent of each other, and added into to test for effectiveness of this feature selection method. Linear correlation coefficients between response and each feature are calculated, and the maximum absolute value of the last ones is determined, The feature is retained in the selected feature group if, i.e. is more correlated to the response than the random variables. Otherwise, is discarded. It is well known that the relationships between features and the response could be nonlinear. The linear correlation coefficient captures the linear relation only, and thus is not accurate in the nonlinear case, which calls for nonlinear correlation coefficient method. The simplest nonlinear correlation coefficient is the Spearmans rank correlation coefficient, and it is more appropriate when the data points seem to follow a curve instead of a straight line, and is less sensitive to the effects of outliers. Spearmans rank correlation coefficient is a measure of statistical dependence between 2 variables, and is defined as the Pearson correlation coefficient between the ranked variables. Given raw data points, are ranked with such that the largest value has rank 1, the second largest value rank 2, etc. whereas are similarly ranked with. Spearmans rank correlation coefficient of and is Pearson correlation coefficient calculated from and. The efficient way to calculate Spearmans rank correlation coefficient is to use The feature selection based Spearmans rank correlation coefficient follows its linear counterpart by replacing the linear correlation coefficients by Spearmans rank correlation coefficient. A new algorithm, called â\x80\x9cLocal Learning Based Feature Selection for High Dimensional Data Analysis of feature selectionâ\x80\x9d, was proposed by Sun et al.. Its core idea is that an arbitrarily complicated nonlinear problem can be decomposed into a series of local linear problems based on local learning and then the feature relevance is learned globally. Their method does not make any assumption on the data distribution, and is capable of selecting useful features successfully from a large number of features that are irrelevant. Its flowchart is shown as follows. Input: Data, kernel width, regulation parameter, stop criterion. Output: Feature weights. 1. Initiation: Set 2. Repeat: a) Compute b) Compute and with equations, and c) Solve for through gradient descent using the update rule, d) 3. Until: 4. In this algorithm, is the feature vector, is the label corresponding to, and d() stands for the Manhattan distance of,. The correlation methods mentioned above only consider correlation from features to response. It tends to select redundant features if these features are all highly related to response but they are mutually correlated too. To select a set of features as good and few as possible for learning task, one must take into consideration possible interdependencies between the features as well. As a trade-off between the complexity of the selection process and the quality of the selected feature set, a pair wise selection strategy has been recently suggested. This method assumes that a feature is irrelevant if it is uncorrelated with response, otherwise it is useful, and the feature is redundant if a feature is highly correlated with other features. In this paper, we propose some modifications. Firstly, we use the rank correlation coefficient instead as it can capture nonlinear relation and is computational efficient. Secondly, we compare correlation from real features with those from pure noises, and retain those features only when they are more relevant than noises. Thirdly, we introduce tuning parameters to allow the users to fit to specific situations. Thus, the main idea of this modified method is to check first whether the features are correlated in linear or nonlinear way to each other. If the correlation coefficients between a feature and other features exceed the correlation coefficient between this feature and response by some extent, it means that this feature is not useful, and its information can be gained from high correlated other features. The detailed procedure is as follows1. Initialization: a) Define the feature sets: Set as the original set of features and the selected feature set as empty set. b) Select the first feature: compute the rank correlation coefficient between the feature and the response. Then include the feature with the largest as the first selected feature in and exclude it from. c) Remove noisy features: compute the rank correlation coefficient between noise and the response y, where. Set the default m as 20. Let the standard deviation of these m coefficients be. Take away from, if be in such that, where is the threshold ratio. 2. Search for relevant features, repeat until no feature is produced from (b) below. a) Compute the rank correlation coefficient for each pair of variables with and. b) Select the next feature: choose feature as the one that maximizes, subject to, where is the threshold ratio. Move from into. 3. Output the set as the selected features. It will be seen from our simulation study below that correlation based methods work badly for time series in general. The best one, the 2D-correlation method, is able to reject irrelevant features but unable to select minimum number of relevant features. We will find causes of their failure through theoretical analysis in the next section. Consider autoregressive process with order, which is described by where is a purely random process with zero mean and variance. Assume this process is stationary. Then multiply through (11) by, take expectations, and divide to get where is the correlation coefficients of and. This holds true, independent of the initial condition and variance of. For, (12) becomes It is shown in Figure 1 for. If the 2D-correlation method is applied to the above case, we find that there is low efficiency in selecting useful features. Suppose that the feature with time lag 1, is selected, features with time lags 2, and 3, should be considered in the subsequent steps. For system in (11) with, it follows from (13) and Figure 1 that features, and, have higher correlation with selected feature, than that with response, and thus are not selected. In general, it is observed that though, are redundant, each of them have significant correlation with response and their values are not necessarily smaller than those of. Besides, they are not necessarily smaller than their own mutual correlations. Thus, the methods mentioned above fail in general. To overcome the drawbacks in the above correlation methods, we propose the progressive correlation method as follows. Select, if correlation of and decreases significantly with that of and y, no longer solely based on single correlation of with y. Further, we also use the correlation of with when we consider after is selected. In this new method, we favor the feature with least time lags when several features with similar relative correlation coefficients exist. And if several groups of selected features have similar modeling residuals, we favor the one with a smaller number of features. The detailed procedure is as follows1. Initialization: a) Define the feature sets: Set as the original set of features and the selected feature set as empty set. b) Select the first feature: compute the rank correlation coefficient between the feature and response. Then find the features which satisfy and select among themone with the least time lag. Include it in and exclude it from. c) Remove noisy features: compute the rank correlation coefficient between noise and the response, where. Set the default as 20. Let the standard deviation of these coefficients be. Let in be such that, where is the threshold ratio. Take away from. 2. Select feature progressively, repeat until the root mean square error of modelled system stops decreasing or there is no feature in: a) Learn a model with the selected features and response, and calculate the model residual series. b) Calculate rank correlation coefficients with. Then calculate relative correlation coefficients with . c) Select the feature which satisfies with minimal time lag from response as the new selected feature in and exclude it from. d) Update the response with the model residual. 3. Varying to different values, and redo step 1. and 2., several groups of features are selected. For those have similar small modelling residuals, we select the one with smaller number of features and less time lag as final selected features. 4. Output the set as the selected features. For testing feature selection on time series, we construct two dynamic systems. The first one is linear system and described by where is white noise with uniform distribution on interval. Coefficients are set as and the initial conditions are set to be. Then the equation gives us a stable system and the response is shown in Figure 2. The second system is nonlinear and described by where is white noise with uniform distribution on interval. At last, we set and the initial conditions are set to be. Its response is shown in Figure 3. The model without the last three terms in the right hand side is cited from which represents some economic model with cycles. As our objective is to predict the system response change based on the past observations, we form the features as and the response for regression as For classification, we define the label for each feature vector from its corresponding response as follows (0% threshold) The data set for learning is thus formed by with the data size equal to. Sometimes, one may be interested in large changes only. Then, one can filter the response with some threshold: a data point in the original data set is kept in the filtered data set for regression if. The other data points are discarded. The size of the filtered data set will thus be usually reduced, depending on the actual response. The filtered data set for classification is obtained by using the same label definition before. Equations (16) to (18) are used to generate the following data sets for both linear and nonlinear systems labeled by The Noise-to-Signal Ratio (NSR) is obtained by In this section, we first the simulation results for 4 existing methods, respectively, and make a comparison. Then, we present results of the proposed methods (2DCorrelation Method and Progressive Correlation Method). Comparisons are made firstly based on the performance for different values of the magnitude of random variables added. After that, normalization is applied to both the feature and response, and performances of the first four methods are then compared in Table 1 to Table 9, respectively. From the results above, we can conclude that the magnitude of random variables added does not have any significant effect on the performance of the 4 methods: linear regression, linear correlation coefficient, rank correlation coefficient, and local learning method. There are some cases when the performance is affected, for example when Spearmans rank correlation method was applied to nonlinear system with NSR = 0.5224 and r = 10, d = 0.01, m = 3, the rejection rate for b = 0.01 is 0.83, for b = 0.1 is 0.67, and for b = 1 is 1. However, in the majority of the cases, the rejection rate and selection rate are about the same. This might be because the random features which were added do not have any correlation with the response, and thus their correlation coefficient with respect to the response is close to 0. When the magnitude of random variables is increased, the correlation coefficient might be increased, but the change is not very big due to the random nature of these variables. Therefore, the threshold level might not have increased by so much, and the performance level is roughly the same. Overall, Dr. Suns method of feature selection based on local learning seems to give the best result. In most cases, it is able to remove at least some, if not the majority of the irrelevant features. However, not all of the relevant features were selected; and it fails altogether in a few cases. Nevertheless, it still gives better result than linear correlation coefficient, rank correlation coefficient, and linear regression, which tends to select most of the features, regardless of whether they are relevant. In the simulation of correlation method, we set the threshold as 1.5 and the parameter as 0.5. In our experiments, it indicates that the magnitude of added random variables do not affect the performance significantly, and is set as fixed one [−1, 1]. The simulation results are shown in Tables 10 and 11. In terms of feature rejection, we observe that the correlation method yields quite positive results. In most of the cases, this method is able to eliminate most of the irre- levant features, with the rate of correctly rejected features almost always higher than 0.5. In some particular situations, the rate of correctly rejected feature stands at 1. This might be because by evaluating the correction coefficient between features, we are able to reduce the number of features that are highly-correlated to each other, and thus feature rejection rate increases. However, there are cases (such as linear data set NSR = 0.8649 with number of features, and the feature threshold level) where correct rejection rate is 0. This might be because is the only irrelevant feature for linear data set, and the number of features were not large enough for the covariance checking to be effective, and hence this irrelevant feature has passed the testing criteria. In terms of feature selection, this method does not give very good results, especially for linear data sets. For most of the test cases for linear data sets, the method is able to select at most 1 feature out of 2 (if) or 3 (if). One possible explanation might be the high correlation coefficient between consecutive feature features. For example, and are consecutive terms in the time series, and hence they are highly correlated. As a result, their correlation coefficient is often higher than the correlation coefficient between the response and feature vector. This weakness should be considered and improve in the extended method. In the simulation of progressive correlation method, we change the response to As both responses come from the same time series, they can be transformed to each other, and either one can be used for feature selection. The threshold is set as 0.1 - 0.8 with step of 0.1, which can give us eight candidate options, and the parameter as 5, which can neglect most noise features. Then we select the final selected features from eight candidate options, and choose the option with smaller response residuals, less number of features as the final selection result. The simulation result is shown in Table 12. From the simulation result, we find this kind of feature selection method yields quite good both in feature selection and feature rejection for data sets with and without noise. For linear data set, the progressive correlation method can accurately select most useful features and reject most irrelevant features for data set without noise. For data set with noise, this method performs better, as it can accurately select all the useful features and rejects most irrelevant features. For nonlinear data set, the progressive correlation method also achieves better results than before. From the result, it can select most useful features and reject most irrelevant features for data sets with no or low NSR. For data set with high noise, it performs a bit worse. But it still can select some useful features and reject all the irrelevant features. This paper has conducted comparative studies of several representative methods for feature selection in the context of time series modeling. A modified correlation method is presented. In most of the cases, this method is able to eliminate most of the irrelevant features. However, it has a poor performance in feature selection, which can only select half of useful features or even less. We show why these methods fail. In order to rectify the causes of failure, we propose the progressive correlation method. It yields the best results, as generally it can remove most irrelevant features and keep most of the relevant features. Further, it works quite consistently in both linear and nonlinear data sets, and over both high and low noisesignal ratio, indicating that it is a robust method, and can work in different conditions. The use of correlation coefficients patterns shown in formula (12) and Figure 1 to select exact number of features is under progress of our research.', 'summary': 'For better modeling, we need to include high predictive capability features and exclude low predictive capability or redundant features from the original group of features.

Other physical systems exhibit disequilibrium movement but due to external factors, the equilibrium state is reached . In mathematics, especially in differential equations, an equilibrium points is an optimal solution to a differential equation. Time optimal control is a method of mathematical optimisation for deriving control policies . Firstly, we will introduce the system of ordinary differential equations  : The Equation (1) introduces the system of ordinary differential equations with an initial state. The is considered to be the state vector. The components are state variables while u is the control vector with control variables presented as. Firstly, u is merely integrable while f is continuously differentiable with respect to so that we can allow for discontinuous changes in its components, the control variables. A control problem that we pose is the following: if we take initial state as when t = 0 what control vector can we choose that will take us to the target state, at time. How can this system be controlled  ? If the cost function is introduced and it is related to control problem, its minimisation by seeking controls u results with an optimal control problem. But we want to have time-optimal control problem. In order to obtain time-optimal control problem, we put and hence so that we seek to minimize the time taken to reach the state. We will study this problem for the relatively simple first order differential linear, constant, coefficient equations: We are going to study a time series graph, one line that is dependent of time and some other variable . We assume that time series graph has an equilibrium position  it is unstable and it can be moving in infinitely small time up and down. However, irrespectively of the other factors, we assume that time series graph has attained its equilibrium value. We want to find out what kind of external factor can affect it and make it move it out of equilibrium, as it is possible, that the time series graph tends to stay in equilibrium. In order to analyse the following problem, we use the following differential equation: where x represents the deviation from the equilibrium value, it could be called vertical deviation from the equilibrium as the 2D time series can move only up and down. As we assume that time series is in equilibrium, u represents external attempts that make the time series graph stays in equilibrium. If we assume that at, the deviation is existent and is presented like. Can this deviation be controlled and if it can be controlled, how quickly can it be controlled? First case that we will analyse is that there is no attempt to control the deviation with, then the solution of equation is the following: With no external factor affecting the time series graph, it is almost certain that the graph will move out of its equilibrium. The equilibrium with is an unstable equilibrium point. In order to apply general control, we can solve (4) by using the integrating factor, so we have the following  : And hence we have: Since we want to have to analyse the system in equilibrium, we must have when, so we must have: As, u must be negative for at least some period from. If is not bounded below, it is easy to choose u to satisfy, for example with, but however as we can only react in short time as stock price movement follows random walk and exchange rate is changing in infinitely small time intervals, we can control the system in an arbitrarily short time by making sufficiently large. At the same time, there are the systems in economy which control is unbounded, but then time-optimal problem is meaningless. We will take external factors to be in the range of. In order to push x back towards the equilibrium as quickly as possible, we need to push as hard as possible by taking, so we get: The solution is then Equation (10) shows that as as. If then the system cannot be controlled back to equilibrium. Figure 1 demonstrates that the equilibrium can only be achieved when deviation is less than one, then equilibrium can be reached. For the values that are higher than the equilibrium solution cannot be reached. What is important to notice is that if x is above or below 1, the system is out of equilibrium, and as the time passes it diverges more from the equilibrium. We will introduce the controllable set which represents the set of initial states that can be controlled to the origin or equilibrium in some time. This is the union of all the controllable sets at time. The controllable set is given as following  : If C is the whole real line, we say that the system is completely controllable. Since our system is not the whole real line, it means it is not completely controllable. Now, we must define the reachable set. It is the set where control exists. From Equation (7), we have: and since, we obtain: so that we have: defines the points in the reachable set. For, the reachable set doesnâ\x80\x99t contain the origin and cannot reach the equilibrium. On the other side for, the origin or equilibrium is reachable for In order to make the final assumption and summarise the analysis the following will be stated. If time series graphs exhibit equilibrium state and tend to diverge from the aforementioned equilibrium state, external influence must be exerted via some of the external factors in order to attain equilibrium. This exertion of external influence can only be conducted in infinitely small time interval and must be sufficiently large. If the external influence or factor is unbounded, then optimal time control is not effective and this is what causes big financial disruptions or disruptions in any sense. It is also proved if equilibrium state of time series exhibit maximally one standard deviation, it can be returned to equilibrium state. Deviations larger than one standard deviation cause series to diverge from equilibrium level and to attain new equilibrium. At the same time, even if new financial equilibrium is established, there is still risk of financial disruption and crisis. Unfortunately, when we move away from time optimal control problem, we have to develop a new theory. At the same time, next step concerning the proposed theory is its testing and calibration. This paper tries to introduce an innovative approach in time series analysis pertaining in that sense to time series that are characterized by equilibrium value. It introduces time optimal control problem and proves that the aforementioned time series can keep their equilibrium in case when the deviation is less than one standard deviation and under the condition that external influence is large enough. In case that external influence is too large, easily financial disruption can be caused. If the deviation from equilibrium is bigger than one s.d, it is possible that new equilibrium state is sought or the system doesnâ\x80\x99t know how to behave and that there is a possibility of financial disruption until the state is stabilised again.', 'summary': 'We assume that time series graph has an equilibrium position  it is unstable and it can be moving in infinitely small time up and down. However, irrespectively of the other factors, we assume that time series graph has attained its equilibrium value. As we assume that time series is in equilibrium, u represents external attempts that make the time series graph stays in equilibrium. We will introduce the controllable set which represents the set of initial states that can be controlled to the origin or equilibrium in some time. If the external influence or factor is unbounded, then optimal time control is not effective and this is what causes big financial disruptions or disruptions in any sense. It is also proved if equilibrium state of time series exhibit maximally one standard deviation, it can be returned to equilibrium state.
