      "by Linda Ajuang Ogallo, Philip Omondi, Gilbert Ouma, Gordon Wayumba, June 2018\n",
      "Increase in temperature could also change the ecology of infectious diseases as well as increase temperature related mortality and morbidity of people and livestock [2] [26] [27] . Climate Change projections for Somalia will be used to derive information regarding the potential increase of the threats of climate extremes on future development and livelihoods. Data from the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) Africa framework was used in this study to project scenarios for precipitation in Lower Jubba. At the same time the analysis showed significant biases in individual models depending on sub-region and season; however, the ensemble mean had better agreement with observation than individual models. The analysis concluded that the multi-model ensemble mean simulates eastern Africa rainfall adequately and could therefore be used for the assessment of future climate projections for the region. The ensemble model data was used in this study to compute the correlation value r and linear trend lines for each pixel for the individual seasons. For the study area, the ensemble mean results were found to simulate fairly well the annual rainfall cycle when compared to individual RCM models. In general, the study revealed some fairly good agreement between annual rainfall cycle simulated by ensemble of CORDEX RCMs and the CHIRPS data. Thus projection of future rainfall scenarios was undertaken for only the Gu (AMJ) season. The projections undertaken for temperature were observed for all seasons. The spatial representation of the projected rainfall trends showed no homogenous patterns throughout the three study sub periods. Like the observed GISTEMP data [20], the average temperature seems to increase towards the southern costal band in all seasons, possibly due to influence by Indian Ocean [50] . In general, the projections for Lower Jubba indicated an increase in minimum and maximum temperatures in all seasons in the projection periods 2030, 2050 and 2070.\n",

      "\n",
      "by Samwel N. Marigi, March 2017\n",
      "The development agenda for Kenya is being widely affected by climate change and its resultant impacts, which could cost the economy a significant percentage of the country’s GDP. This review was aimed at gathering information on prevalent climate related ha- zards, associated impacts, as well as current challenges/gaps in addressing risks posed by the climate change hazards. The available adaptive capacity parameters data (literacy levels, access to health infrastructure) have also been subjected to the same procedure to generate the respective spatial layers. In both areas, the report finds significant economic impacts on water resources by both drought and floods―a very serious drag on the country’s economic perfor- mance. The outcome of the study provides the following key messages for the country: 1) Existing climate variability has significant economic costs in Kenya. The Kenya Government and DMCN [10] undertook a study to enhance the capacity of the country to manage and cope with flood related disasters. The 1997/98 El Niño and the 2006 flood events associated with widespread impacts across the country were considered. It should be pointed out here that floods and drought are the most common hazards in the country and result in the greatest impacts to society. It is observed from the figure that much of northern Kenya has the least capacity to adapt to climate induced hazards compared to the rest of the country. The county’s vulnerability (Figure 1(n)), is the composite of overall country exposure, overall country sensitivity and overall country lack of adaptive capacity (Figure 1(f), Figure 1(j), Figure 1(m)). It has been established in this study that floods and drought are the common hazards in the country that account for the greatest impacts to society. Inadequate skilled human resources such as flood risk managers and modern gauging stations to monitor flood levels also hampers the process of flood risk management in the country. The vulnerability, however, varies across the country depending on the degree of exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacities of systems in the respective areas of the country.\n",

I think it has great potential.” Even more futuristic possibilities include using algae in the veins of astronauts on long-haul space missions, says neurobiologist Hans Straka. “I wouldn’t call it crazy, but unconventional, let’s say.”  The researchers injected either green algae (Chlamydomonas reinhardtii) or cyanobacteria (Synechocystis) into tadpoles’ blood vessels, creating an eerie greenish animal. The algae might also be able to supply nerve cells with glucose, or even molecules that influence nerve cell behavior, he says.\n",

Instead, the little lemurs’ hands may have become too specialized, with thin, elongated fingers, including an especially long third digit that has a ball-and-socket joint. Then the primates bite the wood, puncturing a hole, and again use their long third finger for fishing out bugs and grubs found inside.\n",

      "Prozac, a commonly prescribed medication for kids and teens with autism, is no more effective than a placebo at treating obsessive-compulsive behaviors, a small study finds.

The researchers tracked changes in the subjects’ obsessive and compulsive symptoms, as measured by a behavioral survey used in other studies, before and after treatment.

      "“Your head is attached to your body,” says neuroscientist Shannon Macauley of Wake Forest School of Medicine in Winston-Salem, N.C. Metabolism, sleep and brain health “don’t happen in isolation,” she says. Injections of glucose into the blood led to changes in the brain: a burst of metabolism, a bump in nerve cell activity and more time spent awake. “They’re going to run around in a circle.”  But a dip in blood sugar, caused by insulin injections, also led to more nerve cell action and more wakefulness. In mice with amyloid plaques, higher blood sugar led to a slight rise in brain metabolism, but not nearly as much as in a normal mouse. In mice with lots of tau, however, high blood sugar didn’t increase brain metabolism.\n",

      "October 18, 2019 at 12:49 pm\n",
      "Powerful hurricanes can whip the ocean into a frenzy — and that wave energy can be strong enough to hammer the seafloor, producing a novel kind of quake. They analyzed seismic data collected from 2006 to 2015 by a network of moveable seismometers that marched across the country from west to east as part of the USArray. He became excited, he says, when he found what he thought were previously undetected offshore earthquakes occurring in that mysterious seismic band. Instead, stormquakes were confined to certain regions along the coast where seafloor topography maps indicated that there were small raised regions called ocean banks. Off New Jersey, Fan says, the seafloor descends in a gentle grade along the continental shelf toward deeper ocean. It’s interesting that the researchers were able to track the sources of some of the seismic signals back in time to the storms, says geophysicist Lucia Gualtieri of Stanford University.\n",

Spectral analyses completed soon after the merger indicated that the collision had created a hodgepodge of heavy elements characteristic of the r-process  .

In 2018, telescopes on the ground and in space spotted a series of storms near Saturn’s North Pole (white spots indicated by black arrows). Not all of the storms were visible simultaneously; the shortest-lived lasted about 10 days while the longest-running storm raged for 214 days. These weather disturbances were larger than storms previously seen on the gas giant, but nowhere near as big as Saturn’s rare Great White Spots.\n",

Those images reveal that, like comets native to our solar system, 2I/Borisov’s core is shrouded in a gaseous halo trailed by a faint, broad stream of gas and dust. Preliminary wavelength observations have already hinted that 2I/Borisov contains cyanogen gas (made of carbon and nitrogen atoms), which is relatively common in comets native to the solar system.\n",

Using the computer, named Sycamore, Google researchers performed a task called random circuit sampling. In an October 21 blog post, those IBM researchers argue that their result means that Google hasn’t achieved quantum supremacy after all. IBM has not yet used a supercomputer to perform such a computation, however, so that leaves the quantum supremacy result in a “gray territory,” Kieferová says.

To study this effect, a team of scientists from China, the United States and Brazil twisted fibers of rubber, fishing line and wires made of a nickel and titanium alloy. When twisted tightly enough, the various types of strands formed coils or even supercoils — coils of coils.\n",

      "The story reminded reader Ron Blachman of the IronEx experiments, in which fertilizing the ocean with iron boosted carbon-absorbing algal blooms  . In theory, more blooms could mean more carbon gets stored in the deep ocean. Concern over climate change is resurrecting geoengineering ideas such as Blachman’s, says Science News earth and climate writer Carolyn Gramling. “But there’s a lot we don’t know about consequences.” Some experiments hint that iron fertilization of the ocean could boost levels of nitrous oxide or methane in the atmosphere.\n",

      "Climate change may be throwing coral sex out of sync\n",
      "September 13, 2019 at 9:00 am\n",
      "Spawning is out of sync for at least three widespread coral species in the Red Sea, says Tom Shlesinger, a marine biologist at Tel Aviv University. Shlesinger had seen corals spawn elsewhere, but the night he finally got the timing right to catch an event in the Red Sea was “magical,” he says. Data from 1980 to 1982 on the five studied species show consistent, synchronous patterns of mass spawning, based on regular lab exams of coral samples plus nighttime swims. Biologists have certainly fretted that climate change might also knock coral spawning synchrony askew, says James Guest, a coral biologist at Newcastle University in England. And some corals have a bit of natural play in their timing, says Taryn Foster, a coral biologist at the California Academy of Sciences in San Francisco. Every two or three seasons, they split their spawning into two separate bursts, thus coping with the way moon phases cycle faster than annual cues.\n",

      "In a climate crisis, is geoengineering worth the risks?\n",
      "October 6, 2019 at 8:00 am\n",
      "“We should investigate geoengineering in case we can’t change our behaviors fast enough to ward off the worst of climate change,” Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang notes on his campaign website. What hints scientists do have about the possible effects of geoengineering come from “natural experiments” such as massive volcanic eruptions that briefly but intensely alter atmospheric or ocean conditions  . Ocean seeding, or iron fertilization, is unusual among geoengineering projects: Unlike most geoengineering proposals, ocean seeding has actually been tried in the real world. But the experiments also prompted a powerful response from environmental groups, effectively halting follow-up ocean seeding experiments. Laboratory experiments suggested that as much as 100,000 metric tons of carbon per ton of iron added might be sequestered. Yet after several weeks of monitoring carbon export from the surface waters to deeper waters, the scientists estimated carbon sequestration to be only about 200 tons of carbon per ton of iron. Although the Gulf of Alaska did see subsequent blooms and the salmon catch broke records that year, the company ran afoul of Environment Canada and sparked a debate about opportunistic geoengineering.\n",

      "Malin Pinsky had the first of two lightbulb moments while standing on the bridge of a research ship crossing the churning Drake Passage, which separates the tip of South America and Antarctica. Pinsky’s team is also seeking to understand exactly how a changing climate, as well as overfishing and habitat destruction, might be driving changes in fish and other marine populations. For this, team members travel each year to coral reefs near the Philippines to catalog populations of clown fish, collecting data on growth and mating, sex diversity and other factors. Another focus is whether recent climate change is leading to rapid genetic changes among Atlantic cod and other marine fishes and resulting in, for instance, fish maturing at younger ages. Marine biologist Michelle Stuart, who has worked in Pinsky’s lab at Rutgers since 2013, recalls sitting on the team’s boat, exhausted after a long day of fieldwork.\n",

      "How climate change is already altering oceans and ice, and what’s to come\n",
      "September 25, 2019 at 5:00 am\n",
      "The Greenland ice sheet lost an average 278 billion tons of ice per year from 2006 to 2015. Meanwhile, the Antarctic ice sheet lost an average 155 billion tons per year, or roughly enough to raise seas by an average 0.43 millimeters per year  . Even with global action against climate change, the two massive ice sheets are still expected to contribute a combined 11 centimeters or so of sea level rise by 2100. Aside from the ice that sits atop mountains and landmasses, thick ice blankets the Arctic Sea, with more expansive coverage in the Northern Hemisphere’s winter. Although the sea ice expands and contracts over the course of a year, the overall amount of ice has steadily declined since 1979, the IPCC says. So much melting has left little ice that has endured for at least five years (such hardened ice is expected to be sturdier than single-season ice). In fact, as of last year, the fraction of sea ice older than five years had declined by about 90 percent since 1979, the report says. In a low-emissions future, sea level rise could reach an average 4 millimeters per year in 2100, compared with 15 millimeters per year in a high-emissions future.\n",

      "September 25, 2019 at 5:00 am\n",
      "Earth’s oceans and frozen regions are changing alarmingly quickly, scientists warn in the first comprehensive look at how greenhouse gas emissions are altering the planet’s seas and cryosphere. Since 1993, the rate of warming in the oceans has more than doubled, scientists report in a new study by the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, or IPCC. And it came amidst a surge of global protests, climate strikes and calls for nations around the world to dramatically curb greenhouse gas emissions in hopes of limiting future warming. The new report emphasizes the need to “slash emissions, and do it quickly, or these impacts highlighted in the report will quickly become irreversible…. While the IPCC report rings an alarm bell, there is hope, says climate scientist Ove Hoegh-Guldberg, who heads the Global Change Institute at the University of Queensland in Australia. The U.N. climate meeting in December is also a prelude to a 2020 deadline for Paris Agreement signatories to submit revised and increasingly ambitious plans to reduce their emissions.\n",

      "While fungal diseases have devastated many animal and plant species, humans and other mammals have mostly been spared. That’s probably because mammals have body temperatures too warm for most fungi to replicate as well as powerful immune systems. But climate change may be challenging those defenses, bringing new fungal threats to human health, a microbiologist warns. From 2012 to 2015, pathogenic versions of the fungus Candida auris arose independently in Africa, Asia and South America.\n",

      "Climate change may make it harder to predict the most severe of the El Niño and La Niña weather disturbances in the Pacific Ocean. That’s because these events will become less connected with what happens halfway around the world in the Atlantic, researchers report online August 21 in Science Advances. But as the atmosphere gets warmer, that gas exchange is expected to become more sluggish, weakening the Atlantic’s sway over the Pacific. Future El Niños and La Niñas may not follow the Atlantic events as reliably as in the past, new simulations suggest.\n",

      "As Nepal records at least 9,000 cases of dengue amid an unprecedented outbreak of the disease, workers are fumigating areas of Kathmandu against the mosquitoes that carry the disease.\n",
      "The country had its first-ever dengue outbreak in 2006, but only a handful of people were affected that year from lowland districts along the southern border with India. An estimated 390 million people worldwide get dengue infections every year, with about a quarter developing symptoms, researchers said in a 2013 paper in Nature. But studies show that atmospheric temperatures are the most important drivers for dengue distribution and risk, followed by rainfall patterns, according to a 2016 review paper in Environmental Research. With climate change, “warmer temperatures can affect both the mosquito and the virus,” says coauthor Kristie Ebi, a public health expert at the University of Washington in Seattle. A hotter climate helps mosquito larvae develop faster into adulthood, while also increasing the rate at which the dengue virus replicates within the mosquito, she says.\n",
